"True Detective","DiCaprioFan1","30 September 2022",NA,"The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2)."
"True Detective","ksgillihan","6 February 2023",NA,"Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough."
"True Detective","gogoschka-1","13 January 2014",NA,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"True Detective","grantss","10 August 2015",NA,"(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3Â½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10."
"True Detective","Tweekums","23 March 2020",NA,"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."
"True Detective","ricochet93-369-308802","4 January 2019",NA,"Season one is a beautiful thing.Then Vince Vaughan happened and the less said about that the better."
"True Detective","normaxjean-23753","20 July 2022",NA,"Season 1 still remains the greatest television I've ever seen. McConaughey's best performance to date and Harrelson goes toe-to-toe with him. Everything from the acting (including every minor character) to the writing to the cinematography to the score is phenomenal."
"True Detective","Supermanfan-13","24 February 2021",NA,"True Detective was an absolutely incredible crime series! Like most others here have already said...this is mostly based off Season 1. Season 2, even though it had an amazing cast, was not that good at all & Season 3 was better and absolutely worth watching! There has never been nothing like Season 1 in the history of TV. I'm not saying it's the best show I've ever seen but it's on the list!"
"True Detective","loganschainker","7 July 2022",NA,"True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall. However, True Detective Season 1 is undoubtedly a 10/10."
"True Detective","Funkaairo","16 February 2023",NA,"Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha."
"True Detective","redroominparis","14 January 2019",NA,"Slow paced but well acted, True Detective season 3 returns to its roots. Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface. The Cinematography and Score are fantastic, making for and eagerly anticipated re-do that erases the inadequacy of season 2."
"True Detective","mlynch5187","15 October 2015",NA,"Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. ""Hey, that's okay"" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like ""Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you"". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple."
"True Detective","TomatoesareRotten","21 February 2024",NA,"It's done exactly what the second calamitous series did to the original premise , ruined the whole stock it had re garnered in series 3 ! One step forward two steps back ? The first two episodes set out on a fixed trajectory ( with some arbitrary and random family nonsense for good measure and NO it didn't help with character development ) but then went off ( no pun intended ) on several different paths, one of which was the utterly pointless inclusion of Christopher Eccleston and THAT side story. These deviations only contributed confusion and frustration for the viewer as the main story was, by now, being diluted to the point of insignificance ?! The last episode was some of the poorest storytelling and dialogue I've ever witnessed and it had Jodie Foster contributing her fair share of the nonsense unfolding. Breathtakingly bad, it even made Alaska look terrible and that's quite a feat."
"True Detective","paiello-44319","21 February 2024",NA,"A lot of thoughts, and most of them not good regarding this series of six episodes. The acting was fine, Jody Foster is always fantastic and so was the actress that played Navarro. It was very clichÃ© and that includes the characters and the plot. Seems like they were using the momentum from the previous seasons, which were highly acclaimed. One of those series you kept saying, who is this person again? Or what was the plot again? Most of the violence and murders coming from the good guys, senseless, revenge killings. There were some nonsensical moments as well. People falling through ice after we see Alaska in total darkness with frigid freezing, cold temperatures - the ice would definitely be several feet thick. Anyway there were some threads of high quality acting, but I gave this a score of six and that was generous.My suggestion? Skip season four of the series. I think season one is still regarded as the best. If you want to watch a series that's in the same genre. Watch Fargo season five. Really good stuff."
"True Detective","sammybeno","23 January 2021",NA,"Season 1 of True Detective may be the best television I've ever seen. Its written brilliantly and has some of the best performances I've ever witnessed with Woody and Matthew. They were robbed by not winning an Emmy or Golden Globe."
"True Detective","bsamad-50088","22 November 2019",NA,"I only rated 9 because i didn't like season 2 that much , but season 1 and 3 are just a masterpieces !! Specially the acting of Matthew and Ali , the story and the script , the atmosphere they created in this show is attractive ,i fell in love with the show , one of the best i ever seen"
"True Detective","ladnerlowery","30 March 2021",NA,"I watched season 1 again last week and I am still in awe of every element of this masterpiece. The pace, the acting, everything is so perfect it is mindblowing. I remember the excitement of waiting for season 2, which evaporated after episode 1. Vince Vaughan seems to always carry the can for this seasons issues but they were far larger than one man. I was astounded how bad the second was to the first. The third season, I watched it, I can't remember it. Other than to say it was better than the stinker in the middle."
"True Detective","prabhat_kataria","13 January 2014",NA,"When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichÃ©d murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10"
"True Detective","MK_Ultra_","30 January 2024",NA,"Being a fan of the first season, skipping the second after 2 episodes in (lousy season), and lukewarm on season 3 (was okay), I'm at the point where ""can millions of people be wrong?""Probably not, but just throwing that out there.Season 4, so far, through 3 episodes---for me---is a criminally overrated slog. Who is the protagonist? Why should we care about all the unknown ""soap opera-esque"" hangups between the characters as they develop? There is the element of being derivative hanging over this (hello, John Carpenter), but the element of tribal spiritualism and some inklings of supernatural elements weigh it down as much as they are possibly keeping this series afloat. Talking put of both sides of my mouth, but the trappings of a less than suitable tying up of loose ends is running out of time and space.It's goofy at times (the few scenes with CGI are laughably bad in 2023-2024), it's boring most of the time...but the ending of the episodes bring in the element of the next episode will reveal more, but after three episodes of that same approach, I feel a further letdown on the horizon.It's kind of a mess, bottom line, and the scatterbrained script is really getting hard to watch as it unfolds in slow motion.With that said, this is the halfway point I do believe. Episode 3 out of 6 and just waiting for something to happen.Tempering expectations because a lot of the legitimate nationally publicated reviewers that I normally trust seem to go cuckoo for cocoapuffs over their reviewable full season preview that got me back onboard, but subjective as it can be---and even some calling this more of a ""horror"" themed season, it's falling completely flat other than a few disturbing scenes and the element of what is yet to be revealed.Edited for end of season assessment after watching finale:Absolutely a mess. They ran out of budget or couldn't find an editor to come in and clear.said mess. This is and was a complete disaster of a season, and starting to wonder about the promotional material they ran about the time of the Superbowl, where they folled.the screen with review quote snippets, if those were for all of the MAX content or this series, because a little slight of hand marketing wise might have been in play to sell this crap to the masses.This one's a hard pass."
"True Detective","amappou-565-320033","25 April 2020",NA,"Season 1 True Detective, different actors, different story, different class....absolutely amazing.....the following seasons average in comparison."
"True Detective","danielcereto","2 March 2024",NA,"I really love true detective. Season 1 is one of the greatest shows of all time. Season 2&3 were acceptable even not for everyone. Then season 4, an authentic disaster. I don't know where to start but I'll try.First, the cast (Almost all women) does a really bad job. It is a mixture of bad acting and cheap soap opera feeling. But, to be clear, I have a huge respect to Jodie Foster (Clarice) , but here her acting skills are embarrassing. She is as cold as the supposed plastic ice (embarrassing too).Second, the story is bland, full of cliches and overall unbelievable. A wasted opportunity.So, if you love True Detective, do not watch this. If you love Jodie Foster, watch The Silence of the Lambs. And if you want a great show watch Fargo the first 3 seasons instead."
"True Detective","tomhg38","13 January 2014",NA,"This is a show which almost bathes in success before it's begun. With it's cast and their pedigree of work i cant see many people interested in this type of television not seeing it.Regardless the pilot grips you with non-linear suspense driven story telling. Vaguely some kind of serial killer murders young women in a ritualistic manner and our 2 protagonists catch the case. What follows is a tantalising taste of what I'm sure will become one of the most well wrought shows of the year, as is the norm for HBO. Teased with mystery and the promise of a story worth hearing being told in a superb manner, Its hard not to fully recommend every mature adult checking this show out.The only demographic that wont be thoroughly satisfied with this work are people looking for lighter ""easy watching"" style programs. This isn't an episodic cop show, True Detective is dark and unapologetically twisted."
"True Detective","Silicone54","13 February 2024",NA,"First 15 minutes of episode 1 was pretty good and Jodie Foster is the lead? Yeah lets go!!! Well they went every which way with the entire story and even characters are all doing their own thing. Almost feels like they used different writers to handle each characters' plotlines and no one bothered to check if any of it makes sense.I watched every week and I cannot remember any names including the leads. Impossible to follow the story as they jump from major plot lines to another without any relevance to each other or continuity. I may just stop and wait until the season is complete so I can binge it. Perhaps watching episodes back to back will make it sink in. I love the True Detective series up until this one.I give season 4 a 2-star because of Jodie Foster but honestly she's not convincing at all in her role."
"True Detective","mathomas-28053","2 February 2024",NA,"Season 4 (Night Country)
There are many positive reviews for Jody Foster's ""Night Country."" I cannot imagine we are watching the same thing. I have recently watched the first three seasons of True Detective, and found them all to be very good or excellent. The mysteries were good and complicated. The acting and direction were good. The screenplays were excellent, full of wit, innuendo, plot revealed piece by piece, some wonderful lines of dialogue. Even the minor characters were interested and well-acted.This fourth season is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Nothing about the plot is interesting. None of the characters is interesting. There has not been one witty or memorable line of dialog. I can barely drag myself to watch the next episode. Extremely disappointing.Obviously, this could be a gender difference. The first three seasons were written by guys, about guys, and I am a guy. This fourth season is written by a woman, and stars female detectives. But I have seen PLENTY of excellent detective shows written by and starring women (mostly European) and loved them. So I don't think it's that.I don't know what you people are watching who are giving this fourth season high ratings. I'd rather watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" than suffer through this Alaskan nightmare. Also, I don't approve of bringing supernatural stuff into a detective show, if that's what this is going to turn out to be. Murder is not done by ghosts and spirits, it is done by murderers. I honestly believe these high ratings have been bought and paid for."

Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023.

Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"True Detective","grantss","10 August 2015",NA,"(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3Â½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10."
"True Detective","Tweekums","23 March 2020",NA,"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."
"True Detective","ricochet93-369-308802","4 January 2019",NA,"Season one is a beautiful thing.Then Vince Vaughan happened and the less said about that the better."
"True Detective","normaxjean-23753","20 July 2022",NA,"Season 1 still remains the greatest television I've ever seen. McConaughey's best performance to date and Harrelson goes toe-to-toe with him. Everything from the acting (including every minor character) to the writing to the cinematography to the score is phenomenal."
"True Detective","Supermanfan-13","24 February 2021",NA,"True Detective was an absolutely incredible crime series! Like most others here have already said...this is mostly based off Season 1. Season 2, even though it had an amazing cast, was not that good at all & Season 3 was better and absolutely worth watching! There has never been nothing like Season 1 in the history of TV. I'm not saying it's the best show I've ever seen but it's on the list!"
"True Detective","loganschainker","7 July 2022",NA,"True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall. However, True Detective Season 1 is undoubtedly a 10/10."
"True Detective","Funkaairo","16 February 2023",NA,"Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha."
"True Detective","redroominparis","14 January 2019",NA,"Slow paced but well acted, True Detective season 3 returns to its roots. Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface. The Cinematography and Score are fantastic, making for and eagerly anticipated re-do that erases the inadequacy of season 2."
"True Detective","mlynch5187","15 October 2015",NA,"Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. ""Hey, that's okay"" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like ""Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you"". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple."
"True Detective","TomatoesareRotten","21 February 2024",NA,"It's done exactly what the second calamitous series did to the original premise , ruined the whole stock it had re garnered in series 3 ! One step forward two steps back ? The first two episodes set out on a fixed trajectory ( with some arbitrary and random family nonsense for good measure and NO it didn't help with character development ) but then went off ( no pun intended ) on several different paths, one of which was the utterly pointless inclusion of Christopher Eccleston and THAT side story. These deviations only contributed confusion and frustration for the viewer as the main story was, by now, being diluted to the point of insignificance ?! The last episode was some of the poorest storytelling and dialogue I've ever witnessed and it had Jodie Foster contributing her fair share of the nonsense unfolding. Breathtakingly bad, it even made Alaska look terrible and that's quite a feat."
"True Detective","paiello-44319","21 February 2024",NA,"A lot of thoughts, and most of them not good regarding this series of six episodes. The acting was fine, Jody Foster is always fantastic and so was the actress that played Navarro. It was very clichÃ© and that includes the characters and the plot. Seems like they were using the momentum from the previous seasons, which were highly acclaimed. One of those series you kept saying, who is this person again? Or what was the plot again? Most of the violence and murders coming from the good guys, senseless, revenge killings. There were some nonsensical moments as well. People falling through ice after we see Alaska in total darkness with frigid freezing, cold temperatures - the ice would definitely be several feet thick. Anyway there were some threads of high quality acting, but I gave this a score of six and that was generous.My suggestion? Skip season four of the series. I think season one is still regarded as the best. If you want to watch a series that's in the same genre. Watch Fargo season five. Really good stuff."
"True Detective","sammybeno","23 January 2021",NA,"Season 1 of True Detective may be the best television I've ever seen. Its written brilliantly and has some of the best performances I've ever witnessed with Woody and Matthew. They were robbed by not winning an Emmy or Golden Globe."
"True Detective","bsamad-50088","22 November 2019",NA,"I only rated 9 because i didn't like season 2 that much , but season 1 and 3 are just a masterpieces !! Specially the acting of Matthew and Ali , the story and the script , the atmosphere they created in this show is attractive ,i fell in love with the show , one of the best i ever seen"
"True Detective","ladnerlowery","30 March 2021",NA,"I watched season 1 again last week and I am still in awe of every element of this masterpiece. The pace, the acting, everything is so perfect it is mindblowing. I remember the excitement of waiting for season 2, which evaporated after episode 1. Vince Vaughan seems to always carry the can for this seasons issues but they were far larger than one man. I was astounded how bad the second was to the first. The third season, I watched it, I can't remember it. Other than to say it was better than the stinker in the middle."
"True Detective","prabhat_kataria","13 January 2014",NA,"When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichÃ©d murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10"
"True Detective","MK_Ultra_","30 January 2024",NA,"Being a fan of the first season, skipping the second after 2 episodes in (lousy season), and lukewarm on season 3 (was okay), I'm at the point where ""can millions of people be wrong?""Probably not, but just throwing that out there.Season 4, so far, through 3 episodes---for me---is a criminally overrated slog. Who is the protagonist? Why should we care about all the unknown ""soap opera-esque"" hangups between the characters as they develop? There is the element of being derivative hanging over this (hello, John Carpenter), but the element of tribal spiritualism and some inklings of supernatural elements weigh it down as much as they are possibly keeping this series afloat. Talking put of both sides of my mouth, but the trappings of a less than suitable tying up of loose ends is running out of time and space.It's goofy at times (the few scenes with CGI are laughably bad in 2023-2024), it's boring most of the time...but the ending of the episodes bring in the element of the next episode will reveal more, but after three episodes of that same approach, I feel a further letdown on the horizon.It's kind of a mess, bottom line, and the scatterbrained script is really getting hard to watch as it unfolds in slow motion.With that said, this is the halfway point I do believe. Episode 3 out of 6 and just waiting for something to happen.Tempering expectations because a lot of the legitimate nationally publicated reviewers that I normally trust seem to go cuckoo for cocoapuffs over their reviewable full season preview that got me back onboard, but subjective as it can be---and even some calling this more of a ""horror"" themed season, it's falling completely flat other than a few disturbing scenes and the element of what is yet to be revealed.Edited for end of season assessment after watching finale:Absolutely a mess. They ran out of budget or couldn't find an editor to come in and clear.said mess. This is and was a complete disaster of a season, and starting to wonder about the promotional material they ran about the time of the Superbowl, where they folled.the screen with review quote snippets, if those were for all of the MAX content or this series, because a little slight of hand marketing wise might have been in play to sell this crap to the masses.This one's a hard pass."
"True Detective","amappou-565-320033","25 April 2020",NA,"Season 1 True Detective, different actors, different story, different class....absolutely amazing.....the following seasons average in comparison."
"True Detective","danielcereto","2 March 2024",NA,"I really love true detective. Season 1 is one of the greatest shows of all time. Season 2&3 were acceptable even not for everyone. Then season 4, an authentic disaster. I don't know where to start but I'll try.First, the cast (Almost all women) does a really bad job. It is a mixture of bad acting and cheap soap opera feeling. But, to be clear, I have a huge respect to Jodie Foster (Clarice) , but here her acting skills are embarrassing. She is as cold as the supposed plastic ice (embarrassing too).Second, the story is bland, full of cliches and overall unbelievable. A wasted opportunity.So, if you love True Detective, do not watch this. If you love Jodie Foster, watch The Silence of the Lambs. And if you want a great show watch Fargo the first 3 seasons instead."
"True Detective","tomhg38","13 January 2014",NA,"This is a show which almost bathes in success before it's begun. With it's cast and their pedigree of work i cant see many people interested in this type of television not seeing it.Regardless the pilot grips you with non-linear suspense driven story telling. Vaguely some kind of serial killer murders young women in a ritualistic manner and our 2 protagonists catch the case. What follows is a tantalising taste of what I'm sure will become one of the most well wrought shows of the year, as is the norm for HBO. Teased with mystery and the promise of a story worth hearing being told in a superb manner, Its hard not to fully recommend every mature adult checking this show out.The only demographic that wont be thoroughly satisfied with this work are people looking for lighter ""easy watching"" style programs. This isn't an episodic cop show, True Detective is dark and unapologetically twisted."
"True Detective","Silicone54","13 February 2024",NA,"First 15 minutes of episode 1 was pretty good and Jodie Foster is the lead? Yeah lets go!!! Well they went every which way with the entire story and even characters are all doing their own thing. Almost feels like they used different writers to handle each characters' plotlines and no one bothered to check if any of it makes sense.I watched every week and I cannot remember any names including the leads. Impossible to follow the story as they jump from major plot lines to another without any relevance to each other or continuity. I may just stop and wait until the season is complete so I can binge it. Perhaps watching episodes back to back will make it sink in. I love the True Detective series up until this one.I give season 4 a 2-star because of Jodie Foster but honestly she's not convincing at all in her role."
"True Detective","mathomas-28053","2 February 2024",NA,"Season 4 (Night Country)
There are many positive reviews for Jody Foster's ""Night Country."" I cannot imagine we are watching the same thing. I have recently watched the first three seasons of True Detective, and found them all to be very good or excellent. The mysteries were good and complicated. The acting and direction were good. The screenplays were excellent, full of wit, innuendo, plot revealed piece by piece, some wonderful lines of dialogue. Even the minor characters were interested and well-acted.This fourth season is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Nothing about the plot is interesting. None of the characters is interesting. There has not been one witty or memorable line of dialog. I can barely drag myself to watch the next episode. Extremely disappointing.Obviously, this could be a gender difference. The first three seasons were written by guys, about guys, and I am a guy. This fourth season is written by a woman, and stars female detectives. But I have seen PLENTY of excellent detective shows written by and starring women (mostly European) and loved them. So I don't think it's that.I don't know what you people are watching who are giving this fourth season high ratings. I'd rather watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" than suffer through this Alaskan nightmare. Also, I don't approve of bringing supernatural stuff into a detective show, if that's what this is going to turn out to be. Murder is not done by ghosts and spirits, it is done by murderers. I honestly believe these high ratings have been bought and paid for."

He does crazy better than crazy people. And he usually steals any scene not nailed down.But Matthew McConaughey operates at such a level here -- not to mention the astonishing makeup which makes him appear to be playing his own father -- that he walks off with this production.

"True Detective","DiCaprioFan1","30 September 2022",NA,"The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2)."
"True Detective","ksgillihan","6 February 2023",NA,"Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough."
"True Detective","gogoschka-1","13 January 2014",NA,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"True Detective","grantss","10 August 2015",NA,"(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3Â½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10."
"True Detective","Tweekums","23 March 2020",NA,"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."

"True Detective","Supermanfan-13","24 February 2021",NA,"True Detective was an absolutely incredible crime series! Like most others here have already said...this is mostly based off Season 1. Season 2, even though it had an amazing cast, was not that good at all & Season 3 was better and absolutely worth watching! There has never been nothing like Season 1 in the history of TV. I'm not saying it's the best show I've ever seen but it's on the list!"
"True Detective","loganschainker","7 July 2022",NA,"True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall. However, True Detective Season 1 is undoubtedly a 10/10."
"True Detective","Funkaairo","16 February 2023",NA,"Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha."
"True Detective","redroominparis","14 January 2019",NA,"Slow paced but well acted, True Detective season 3 returns to its roots. Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface. The Cinematography and Score are fantastic, making for and eagerly anticipated re-do that erases the inadequacy of season 2."
"True Detective","mlynch5187","15 October 2015",NA,"Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. ""Hey, that's okay"" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like ""Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you"". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple."
"True Detective","TomatoesareRotten","21 February 2024",NA,"It's done exactly what the second calamitous series did to the original premise , ruined the whole stock it had re garnered in series 3 ! One step forward two steps back ? The first two episodes set out on a fixed trajectory ( with some arbitrary and random family nonsense for good measure and NO it didn't help with character development ) but then went off ( no pun intended ) on several different paths, one of which was the utterly pointless inclusion of Christopher Eccleston and THAT side story. These deviations only contributed confusion and frustration for the viewer as the main story was, by now, being diluted to the point of insignificance ?! The last episode was some of the poorest storytelling and dialogue I've ever witnessed and it had Jodie Foster contributing her fair share of the nonsense unfolding. Breathtakingly bad, it even made Alaska look terrible and that's quite a feat."
"True Detective","paiello-44319","21 February 2024",NA,"A lot of thoughts, and most of them not good regarding this series of six episodes. The acting was fine, Jody Foster is always fantastic and so was the actress that played Navarro. It was very clichÃ© and that includes the characters and the plot. Seems like they were using the momentum from the previous seasons, which were highly acclaimed. One of those series you kept saying, who is this person again? Or what was the plot again? Most of the violence and murders coming from the good guys, senseless, revenge killings. There were some nonsensical moments as well. People falling through ice after we see Alaska in total darkness with frigid freezing, cold temperatures - the ice would definitely be several feet thick. Anyway there were some threads of high quality acting, but I gave this a score of six and that was generous.My suggestion? Skip season four of the series. I think season one is still regarded as the best. If you want to watch a series that's in the same genre. Watch Fargo season five. Really good stuff."
"True Detective","sammybeno","23 January 2021",NA,"Season 1 of True Detective may be the best television I've ever seen. Its written brilliantly and has some of the best performances I've ever witnessed with Woody and Matthew. They were robbed by not winning an Emmy or Golden Globe."

"True Detective","ladnerlowery","30 March 2021",NA,"I watched season 1 again last week and I am still in awe of every element of this masterpiece. The pace, the acting, everything is so perfect it is mindblowing. I remember the excitement of waiting for season 2, which evaporated after episode 1. Vince Vaughan seems to always carry the can for this seasons issues but they were far larger than one man. I was astounded how bad the second was to the first. The third season, I watched it, I can't remember it. Other than to say it was better than the stinker in the middle."
"True Detective","prabhat_kataria","13 January 2014",NA,"When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichÃ©d murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10"
"True Detective","MK_Ultra_","30 January 2024",NA,"Being a fan of the first season, skipping the second after 2 episodes in (lousy season), and lukewarm on season 3 (was okay), I'm at the point where ""can millions of people be wrong?""Probably not, but just throwing that out there.Season 4, so far, through 3 episodes---for me---is a criminally overrated slog. Who is the protagonist? Why should we care about all the unknown ""soap opera-esque"" hangups between the characters as they develop? There is the element of being derivative hanging over this (hello, John Carpenter), but the element of tribal spiritualism and some inklings of supernatural elements weigh it down as much as they are possibly keeping this series afloat. Talking put of both sides of my mouth, but the trappings of a less than suitable tying up of loose ends is running out of time and space.It's goofy at times (the few scenes with CGI are laughably bad in 2023-2024), it's boring most of the time...but the ending of the episodes bring in the element of the next episode will reveal more, but after three episodes of that same approach, I feel a further letdown on the horizon.It's kind of a mess, bottom line, and the scatterbrained script is really getting hard to watch as it unfolds in slow motion.With that said, this is the halfway point I do believe. Episode 3 out of 6 and just waiting for something to happen.Tempering expectations because a lot of the legitimate nationally publicated reviewers that I normally trust seem to go cuckoo for cocoapuffs over their reviewable full season preview that got me back onboard, but subjective as it can be---and even some calling this more of a ""horror"" themed season, it's falling completely flat other than a few disturbing scenes and the element of what is yet to be revealed.Edited for end of season assessment after watching finale:Absolutely a mess. They ran out of budget or couldn't find an editor to come in and clear.said mess. This is and was a complete disaster of a season, and starting to wonder about the promotional material they ran about the time of the Superbowl, where they folled.the screen with review quote snippets, if those were for all of the MAX content or this series, because a little slight of hand marketing wise might have been in play to sell this crap to the masses.This one's a hard pass."

"True Detective","danielcereto","2 March 2024",NA,"I really love true detective. Season 1 is one of the greatest shows of all time. Season 2&3 were acceptable even not for everyone. Then season 4, an authentic disaster. I don't know where to start but I'll try.First, the cast (Almost all women) does a really bad job. It is a mixture of bad acting and cheap soap opera feeling. But, to be clear, I have a huge respect to Jodie Foster (Clarice) , but here her acting skills are embarrassing. She is as cold as the supposed plastic ice (embarrassing too).Second, the story is bland, full of cliches and overall unbelievable. A wasted opportunity.So, if you love True Detective, do not watch this. If you love Jodie Foster, watch The Silence of the Lambs. And if you want a great show watch Fargo the first 3 seasons instead."
"True Detective","tomhg38","13 January 2014",NA,"This is a show which almost bathes in success before it's begun. With it's cast and their pedigree of work i cant see many people interested in this type of television not seeing it.Regardless the pilot grips you with non-linear suspense driven story telling. Vaguely some kind of serial killer murders young women in a ritualistic manner and our 2 protagonists catch the case. What follows is a tantalising taste of what I'm sure will become one of the most well wrought shows of the year, as is the norm for HBO. Teased with mystery and the promise of a story worth hearing being told in a superb manner, Its hard not to fully recommend every mature adult checking this show out.The only demographic that wont be thoroughly satisfied with this work are people looking for lighter ""easy watching"" style programs. This isn't an episodic cop show, True Detective is dark and unapologetically twisted."

Well they went every which way with the entire story and even characters are all doing their own thing. Almost feels like they used different writers to handle each characters' plotlines and no one bothered to check if any of it makes sense.I watched every week and I cannot remember any names including the leads. Impossible to follow the story as they jump from major plot lines to another without any relevance to each other or continuity. I may just stop and wait until the season is complete so I can binge it. Perhaps watching episodes back to back will make it sink in. I love the True Detective series up until this one.I give season 4 a 2-star because of Jodie Foster but honestly she's not convincing at all in her role."
"True Detective","mathomas-28053","2 February 2024",NA,"Season 4 (Night Country)
There are many positive reviews for Jody Foster's ""Night Country."" I cannot imagine we are watching the same thing. I have recently watched the first three seasons of True Detective, and found them all to be very good or excellent. The mysteries were good and complicated. The acting and direction were good. The screenplays were excellent, full of wit, innuendo, plot revealed piece by piece, some wonderful lines of dialogue. Even the minor characters were interested and well-acted.This fourth season is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Nothing about the plot is interesting. None of the characters is interesting. There has not been one witty or memorable line of dialog. I can barely drag myself to watch the next episode. Extremely disappointing.Obviously, this could be a gender difference. The first three seasons were written by guys, about guys, and I am a guy. This fourth season is written by a woman, and stars female detectives. But I have seen PLENTY of excellent detective shows written by and starring women (mostly European) and loved them. So I don't think it's that.I don't know what you people are watching who are giving this fourth season high ratings. I'd rather watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" than suffer through this Alaskan nightmare. Also, I don't approve of bringing supernatural stuff into a detective show, if that's what this is going to turn out to be. Murder is not done by ghosts and spirits, it is done by murderers. I honestly believe these high ratings have been bought and paid for."

"True Detective","DiCaprioFan1","30 September 2022",NA,"The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2)."
"True Detective","ksgillihan","6 February 2023",NA,"Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough."
"True Detective","gogoschka-1","13 January 2014",NA,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"True Detective","grantss","10 August 2015",NA,"(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3Â½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10."
"True Detective","Tweekums","23 March 2020",NA,"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."

Season 2, even though it had an amazing cast, was not that good at all & Season 3 was better and absolutely worth watching! There has never been nothing like Season 1 in the history of TV.

"True Detective","loganschainker","7 July 2022",NA,"True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall. However, True Detective Season 1 is undoubtedly a 10/10."
"True Detective","Funkaairo","16 February 2023",NA,"Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha."
"True Detective","redroominparis","14 January 2019",NA,"Slow paced but well acted, True Detective season 3 returns to its roots. Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface. The Cinematography and Score are fantastic, making for and eagerly anticipated re-do that erases the inadequacy of season 2."
"True Detective","mlynch5187","15 October 2015",NA,"Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. ""Hey, that's okay"" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like ""Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you"". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple."
"True Detective","TomatoesareRotten","21 February 2024",NA,"It's done exactly what the second calamitous series did to the original premise , ruined the whole stock it had re garnered in series 3 ! One step forward two steps back ? The first two episodes set out on a fixed trajectory ( with some arbitrary and random family nonsense for good measure and NO it didn't help with character development ) but then went off ( no pun intended ) on several different paths, one of which was the utterly pointless inclusion of Christopher Eccleston and THAT side story. These deviations only contributed confusion and frustration for the viewer as the main story was, by now, being diluted to the point of insignificance ?! The last episode was some of the poorest storytelling and dialogue I've ever witnessed and it had Jodie Foster contributing her fair share of the nonsense unfolding. Breathtakingly bad, it even made Alaska look terrible and that's quite a feat."
"True Detective","paiello-44319","21 February 2024",NA,"A lot of thoughts, and most of them not good regarding this series of six episodes. The acting was fine, Jody Foster is always fantastic and so was the actress that played Navarro. It was very clichÃ© and that includes the characters and the plot. Seems like they were using the momentum from the previous seasons, which were highly acclaimed. One of those series you kept saying, who is this person again? Or what was the plot again? Most of the violence and murders coming from the good guys, senseless, revenge killings. There were some nonsensical moments as well. People falling through ice after we see Alaska in total darkness with frigid freezing, cold temperatures - the ice would definitely be several feet thick. Anyway there were some threads of high quality acting, but I gave this a score of six and that was generous.My suggestion? Skip season four of the series. I think season one is still regarded as the best. If you want to watch a series that's in the same genre. Watch Fargo season five. Really good stuff."
"True Detective","sammybeno","23 January 2021",NA,"Season 1 of True Detective may be the best television I've ever seen. Its written brilliantly and has some of the best performances I've ever witnessed with Woody and Matthew. They were robbed by not winning an Emmy or Golden Globe."

The pace, the acting, everything is so perfect it is mindblowing. I remember the excitement of waiting for season 2, which evaporated after episode 1. Vince Vaughan seems to always carry the can for this seasons issues but they were far larger than one man. I was astounded how bad the second was to the first. The third season, I watched it, I can't remember it. Other than to say it was better than the stinker in the middle."
"True Detective","prabhat_kataria","13 January 2014",NA,"When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichÃ©d murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10"
"True Detective","MK_Ultra_","30 January 2024",NA,"Being a fan of the first season, skipping the second after 2 episodes in (lousy season), and lukewarm on season 3 (was okay), I'm at the point where ""can millions of people be wrong?""Probably not, but just throwing that out there.Season 4, so far, through 3 episodes---for me---is a criminally overrated slog. Who is the protagonist? Why should we care about all the unknown ""soap opera-esque"" hangups between the characters as they develop? There is the element of being derivative hanging over this (hello, John Carpenter), but the element of tribal spiritualism and some inklings of supernatural elements weigh it down as much as they are possibly keeping this series afloat. Talking put of both sides of my mouth, but the trappings of a less than suitable tying up of loose ends is running out of time and space.It's goofy at times (the few scenes with CGI are laughably bad in 2023-2024), it's boring most of the time...but the ending of the episodes bring in the element of the next episode will reveal more, but after three episodes of that same approach, I feel a further letdown on the horizon.It's kind of a mess, bottom line, and the scatterbrained script is really getting hard to watch as it unfolds in slow motion.With that said, this is the halfway point I do believe. Episode 3 out of 6 and just waiting for something to happen.Tempering expectations because a lot of the legitimate nationally publicated reviewers that I normally trust seem to go cuckoo for cocoapuffs over their reviewable full season preview that got me back onboard, but subjective as it can be---and even some calling this more of a ""horror"" themed season, it's falling completely flat other than a few disturbing scenes and the element of what is yet to be revealed.Edited for end of season assessment after watching finale:Absolutely a mess. They ran out of budget or couldn't find an editor to come in and clear.said mess. This is and was a complete disaster of a season, and starting to wonder about the promotional material they ran about the time of the Superbowl, where they folled.the screen with review quote snippets, if those were for all of the MAX content or this series, because a little slight of hand marketing wise might have been in play to sell this crap to the masses.This one's a hard pass."

"True Detective","danielcereto","2 March 2024",NA,"I really love true detective. Season 1 is one of the greatest shows of all time. Season 2&3 were acceptable even not for everyone. Then season 4, an authentic disaster. I don't know where to start but I'll try.First, the cast (Almost all women) does a really bad job. It is a mixture of bad acting and cheap soap opera feeling. But, to be clear, I have a huge respect to Jodie Foster (Clarice) , but here her acting skills are embarrassing. She is as cold as the supposed plastic ice (embarrassing too).Second, the story is bland, full of cliches and overall unbelievable. A wasted opportunity.So, if you love True Detective, do not watch this. If you love Jodie Foster, watch The Silence of the Lambs. And if you want a great show watch Fargo the first 3 seasons instead."
"True Detective","tomhg38","13 January 2014",NA,"This is a show which almost bathes in success before it's begun. With it's cast and their pedigree of work i cant see many people interested in this type of television not seeing it.Regardless the pilot grips you with non-linear suspense driven story telling. Vaguely some kind of serial killer murders young women in a ritualistic manner and our 2 protagonists catch the case. What follows is a tantalising taste of what I'm sure will become one of the most well wrought shows of the year, as is the norm for HBO. Teased with mystery and the promise of a story worth hearing being told in a superb manner, Its hard not to fully recommend every mature adult checking this show out.The only demographic that wont be thoroughly satisfied with this work are people looking for lighter ""easy watching"" style programs. This isn't an episodic cop show, True Detective is dark and unapologetically twisted."
"True Detective","Silicone54","13 February 2024",NA,"First 15 minutes of episode 1 was pretty good and Jodie Foster is the lead? Yeah lets go!!! Well they went every which way with the entire story and even characters are all doing their own thing. Almost feels like they used different writers to handle each characters' plotlines and no one bothered to check if any of it makes sense.I watched every week and I cannot remember any names including the leads. Impossible to follow the story as they jump from major plot lines to another without any relevance to each other or continuity. I may just stop and wait until the season is complete so I can binge it. Perhaps watching episodes back to back will make it sink in. I love the True Detective series up until this one.I give season 4 a 2-star because of Jodie Foster but honestly she's not convincing at all in her role."
"True Detective","mathomas-28053","2 February 2024",NA,"Season 4 (Night Country)
There are many positive reviews for Jody Foster's ""Night Country."" I cannot imagine we are watching the same thing. I have recently watched the first three seasons of True Detective, and found them all to be very good or excellent. The mysteries were good and complicated. The acting and direction were good. The screenplays were excellent, full of wit, innuendo, plot revealed piece by piece, some wonderful lines of dialogue. Even the minor characters were interested and well-acted.This fourth season is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Nothing about the plot is interesting. None of the characters is interesting. There has not been one witty or memorable line of dialog. I can barely drag myself to watch the next episode. Extremely disappointing.Obviously, this could be a gender difference. The first three seasons were written by guys, about guys, and I am a guy. This fourth season is written by a woman, and stars female detectives. But I have seen PLENTY of excellent detective shows written by and starring women (mostly European) and loved them. So I don't think it's that.I don't know what you people are watching who are giving this fourth season high ratings. I'd rather watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" than suffer through this Alaskan nightmare. Also, I don't approve of bringing supernatural stuff into a detective show, if that's what this is going to turn out to be. Murder is not done by ghosts and spirits, it is done by murderers. I honestly believe these high ratings have been bought and paid for."

And he usually steals any scene not nailed down.But Matthew McConaughey operates at such a level here -- not to mention the astonishing makeup which makes him appear to be playing his own father -- that he walks off with this production. Mesmerizing.Everyone is pitch perfect, which I believe explains the casting awards.

"True Detective","DiCaprioFan1","30 September 2022",NA,"The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2)."
"True Detective","ksgillihan","6 February 2023",NA,"Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough."
"True Detective","gogoschka-1","13 January 2014",NA,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"True Detective","grantss","10 August 2015",NA,"(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3Â½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10."
"True Detective","Tweekums","23 March 2020",NA,"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."

It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha."
"True Detective","redroominparis","14 January 2019",NA,"Slow paced but well acted, True Detective season 3 returns to its roots. Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface.

"True Detective","mlynch5187","15 October 2015",NA,"Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. ""Hey, that's okay"" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like ""Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you"". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple."
"True Detective","TomatoesareRotten","21 February 2024",NA,"It's done exactly what the second calamitous series did to the original premise , ruined the whole stock it had re garnered in series 3 ! One step forward two steps back ? The first two episodes set out on a fixed trajectory ( with some arbitrary and random family nonsense for good measure and NO it didn't help with character development ) but then went off ( no pun intended ) on several different paths, one of which was the utterly pointless inclusion of Christopher Eccleston and THAT side story. These deviations only contributed confusion and frustration for the viewer as the main story was, by now, being diluted to the point of insignificance ?! The last episode was some of the poorest storytelling and dialogue I've ever witnessed and it had Jodie Foster contributing her fair share of the nonsense unfolding. Breathtakingly bad, it even made Alaska look terrible and that's quite a feat."
"True Detective","paiello-44319","21 February 2024",NA,"A lot of thoughts, and most of them not good regarding this series of six episodes. The acting was fine, Jody Foster is always fantastic and so was the actress that played Navarro. It was very clichÃ© and that includes the characters and the plot. Seems like they were using the momentum from the previous seasons, which were highly acclaimed. One of those series you kept saying, who is this person again? Or what was the plot again? Most of the violence and murders coming from the good guys, senseless, revenge killings. There were some nonsensical moments as well. People falling through ice after we see Alaska in total darkness with frigid freezing, cold temperatures - the ice would definitely be several feet thick. Anyway there were some threads of high quality acting, but I gave this a score of six and that was generous.My suggestion? Skip season four of the series. I think season one is still regarded as the best. If you want to watch a series that's in the same genre. Watch Fargo season five. Really good stuff."
"True Detective","sammybeno","23 January 2021",NA,"Season 1 of True Detective may be the best television I've ever seen. Its written brilliantly and has some of the best performances I've ever witnessed with Woody and Matthew. They were robbed by not winning an Emmy or Golden Globe."

Vince Vaughan seems to always carry the can for this seasons issues but they were far larger than one man. I was astounded how bad the second was to the first. The third season, I watched it, I can't remember it. Other than to say it was better than the stinker in the middle."
"True Detective","prabhat_kataria","13 January 2014",NA,"When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichÃ©d murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10"
"True Detective","MK_Ultra_","30 January 2024",NA,"Being a fan of the first season, skipping the second after 2 episodes in (lousy season), and lukewarm on season 3 (was okay), I'm at the point where ""can millions of people be wrong?""Probably not, but just throwing that out there.Season 4, so far, through 3 episodes---for me---is a criminally overrated slog. Who is the protagonist? Why should we care about all the unknown ""soap opera-esque"" hangups between the characters as they develop? There is the element of being derivative hanging over this (hello, John Carpenter), but the element of tribal spiritualism and some inklings of supernatural elements weigh it down as much as they are possibly keeping this series afloat. Talking put of both sides of my mouth, but the trappings of a less than suitable tying up of loose ends is running out of time and space.It's goofy at times (the few scenes with CGI are laughably bad in 2023-2024), it's boring most of the time...but the ending of the episodes bring in the element of the next episode will reveal more, but after three episodes of that same approach, I feel a further letdown on the horizon.It's kind of a mess, bottom line, and the scatterbrained script is really getting hard to watch as it unfolds in slow motion.With that said, this is the halfway point I do believe. Episode 3 out of 6 and just waiting for something to happen.Tempering expectations because a lot of the legitimate nationally publicated reviewers that I normally trust seem to go cuckoo for cocoapuffs over their reviewable full season preview that got me back onboard, but subjective as it can be---and even some calling this more of a ""horror"" themed season, it's falling completely flat other than a few disturbing scenes and the element of what is yet to be revealed.Edited for end of season assessment after watching finale:Absolutely a mess. They ran out of budget or couldn't find an editor to come in and clear.said mess. This is and was a complete disaster of a season, and starting to wonder about the promotional material they ran about the time of the Superbowl, where they folled.the screen with review quote snippets, if those were for all of the MAX content or this series, because a little slight of hand marketing wise might have been in play to sell this crap to the masses.This one's a hard pass."
"True Detective","amappou-565-320033","25 April 2020",NA,"Season 1 True Detective, different actors, different story, different class....absolutely amazing.....the following seasons average in comparison."
"True Detective","danielcereto","2 March 2024",NA,"I really love true detective. Season 1 is one of the greatest shows of all time. Season 2&3 were acceptable even not for everyone. Then season 4, an authentic disaster. I don't know where to start but I'll try.First, the cast (Almost all women) does a really bad job. It is a mixture of bad acting and cheap soap opera feeling. But, to be clear, I have a huge respect to Jodie Foster (Clarice) , but here her acting skills are embarrassing. She is as cold as the supposed plastic ice (embarrassing too).Second, the story is bland, full of cliches and overall unbelievable. A wasted opportunity.So, if you love True Detective, do not watch this. If you love Jodie Foster, watch The Silence of the Lambs. And if you want a great show watch Fargo the first 3 seasons instead."
"True Detective","tomhg38","13 January 2014",NA,"This is a show which almost bathes in success before it's begun. With it's cast and their pedigree of work i cant see many people interested in this type of television not seeing it.Regardless the pilot grips you with non-linear suspense driven story telling. Vaguely some kind of serial killer murders young women in a ritualistic manner and our 2 protagonists catch the case. What follows is a tantalising taste of what I'm sure will become one of the most well wrought shows of the year, as is the norm for HBO. Teased with mystery and the promise of a story worth hearing being told in a superb manner, Its hard not to fully recommend every mature adult checking this show out.The only demographic that wont be thoroughly satisfied with this work are people looking for lighter ""easy watching"" style programs. This isn't an episodic cop show, True Detective is dark and unapologetically twisted."
"True Detective","Silicone54","13 February 2024",NA,"First 15 minutes of episode 1 was pretty good and Jodie Foster is the lead? Yeah lets go!!! Well they went every which way with the entire story and even characters are all doing their own thing. Almost feels like they used different writers to handle each characters' plotlines and no one bothered to check if any of it makes sense.I watched every week and I cannot remember any names including the leads. Impossible to follow the story as they jump from major plot lines to another without any relevance to each other or continuity. I may just stop and wait until the season is complete so I can binge it. Perhaps watching episodes back to back will make it sink in. I love the True Detective series up until this one.I give season 4 a 2-star because of Jodie Foster but honestly she's not convincing at all in her role."
"True Detective","mathomas-28053","2 February 2024",NA,"Season 4 (Night Country)
There are many positive reviews for Jody Foster's ""Night Country."" I cannot imagine we are watching the same thing. I have recently watched the first three seasons of True Detective, and found them all to be very good or excellent. The mysteries were good and complicated. The acting and direction were good. The screenplays were excellent, full of wit, innuendo, plot revealed piece by piece, some wonderful lines of dialogue. Even the minor characters were interested and well-acted.This fourth season is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Nothing about the plot is interesting. None of the characters is interesting. There has not been one witty or memorable line of dialog. I can barely drag myself to watch the next episode. Extremely disappointing.Obviously, this could be a gender difference. The first three seasons were written by guys, about guys, and I am a guy. This fourth season is written by a woman, and stars female detectives. But I have seen PLENTY of excellent detective shows written by and starring women (mostly European) and loved them. So I don't think it's that.I don't know what you people are watching who are giving this fourth season high ratings. I'd rather watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" than suffer through this Alaskan nightmare. Also, I don't approve of bringing supernatural stuff into a detective show, if that's what this is going to turn out to be. Murder is not done by ghosts and spirits, it is done by murderers. I honestly believe these high ratings have been bought and paid for."

And he usually steals any scene not nailed down.But Matthew McConaughey operates at such a level here -- not to mention the astonishing makeup which makes him appear to be playing his own father -- that he walks off with this production. Mesmerizing.Everyone is pitch perfect, which I believe explains the casting awards.

"True Detective","DiCaprioFan1","30 September 2022",NA,"The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2)."
"True Detective","ksgillihan","6 February 2023",NA,"Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough."
"True Detective","gogoschka-1","13 January 2014",NA,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"True Detective","grantss","10 August 2015",NA,"(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3Â½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10."
"True Detective","Tweekums","23 March 2020",NA,"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."

"True Detective","loganschainker","7 July 2022",NA,"True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall. However, True Detective Season 1 is undoubtedly a 10/10."
"True Detective","Funkaairo","16 February 2023",NA,"Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1.

The first two episodes set out on a fixed trajectory ( with some arbitrary and random family nonsense for good measure and NO it didn't help with character development ) but then went off ( no pun intended ) on several different paths, one of which was the utterly pointless inclusion of Christopher Eccleston and THAT side story. These deviations only contributed confusion and frustration for the viewer as the main story was, by now, being diluted to the point of insignificance ?! The last episode was some of the poorest storytelling and dialogue I've ever witnessed and it had Jodie Foster contributing her fair share of the nonsense unfolding. Breathtakingly bad, it even made Alaska look terrible and that's quite a feat."
"True Detective","paiello-44319","21 February 2024",NA,"A lot of thoughts, and most of them not good regarding this series of six episodes. The acting was fine, Jody Foster is always fantastic and so was the actress that played Navarro. It was very clichÃ© and that includes the characters and the plot. Seems like they were using the momentum from the previous seasons, which were highly acclaimed. One of those series you kept saying, who is this person again? Or what was the plot again? Most of the violence and murders coming from the good guys, senseless, revenge killings. There were some nonsensical moments as well. People falling through ice after we see Alaska in total darkness with frigid freezing, cold temperatures - the ice would definitely be several feet thick. Anyway there were some threads of high quality acting, but I gave this a score of six and that was generous.My suggestion? Skip season four of the series. I think season one is still regarded as the best. If you want to watch a series that's in the same genre. Watch Fargo season five. Really good stuff."

"True Detective","prabhat_kataria","13 January 2014",NA,"When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichÃ©d murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10"
"True Detective","MK_Ultra_","30 January 2024",NA,"Being a fan of the first season, skipping the second after 2 episodes in (lousy season), and lukewarm on season 3 (was okay), I'm at the point where ""can millions of people be wrong?""Probably not, but just throwing that out there.Season 4, so far, through 3 episodes---for me---is a criminally overrated slog. Who is the protagonist? Why should we care about all the unknown ""soap opera-esque"" hangups between the characters as they develop? There is the element of being derivative hanging over this (hello, John Carpenter), but the element of tribal spiritualism and some inklings of supernatural elements weigh it down as much as they are possibly keeping this series afloat. Talking put of both sides of my mouth, but the trappings of a less than suitable tying up of loose ends is running out of time and space.It's goofy at times (the few scenes with CGI are laughably bad in 2023-2024), it's boring most of the time...but the ending of the episodes bring in the element of the next episode will reveal more, but after three episodes of that same approach, I feel a further letdown on the horizon.It's kind of a mess, bottom line, and the scatterbrained script is really getting hard to watch as it unfolds in slow motion.With that said, this is the halfway point I do believe. Episode 3 out of 6 and just waiting for something to happen.Tempering expectations because a lot of the legitimate nationally publicated reviewers that I normally trust seem to go cuckoo for cocoapuffs over their reviewable full season preview that got me back onboard, but subjective as it can be---and even some calling this more of a ""horror"" themed season, it's falling completely flat other than a few disturbing scenes and the element of what is yet to be revealed.Edited for end of season assessment after watching finale:Absolutely a mess. They ran out of budget or couldn't find an editor to come in and clear.said mess. This is and was a complete disaster of a season, and starting to wonder about the promotional material they ran about the time of the Superbowl, where they folled.the screen with review quote snippets, if those were for all of the MAX content or this series, because a little slight of hand marketing wise might have been in play to sell this crap to the masses.This one's a hard pass."

"True Detective","danielcereto","2 March 2024",NA,"I really love true detective. Season 1 is one of the greatest shows of all time. Season 2&3 were acceptable even not for everyone. Then season 4, an authentic disaster. I don't know where to start but I'll try.First, the cast (Almost all women) does a really bad job. It is a mixture of bad acting and cheap soap opera feeling. But, to be clear, I have a huge respect to Jodie Foster (Clarice) , but here her acting skills are embarrassing. She is as cold as the supposed plastic ice (embarrassing too).Second, the story is bland, full of cliches and overall unbelievable. A wasted opportunity.So, if you love True Detective, do not watch this. If you love Jodie Foster, watch The Silence of the Lambs. And if you want a great show watch Fargo the first 3 seasons instead."
"True Detective","tomhg38","13 January 2014",NA,"This is a show which almost bathes in success before it's begun. With it's cast and their pedigree of work i cant see many people interested in this type of television not seeing it.Regardless the pilot grips you with non-linear suspense driven story telling. Vaguely some kind of serial killer murders young women in a ritualistic manner and our 2 protagonists catch the case. What follows is a tantalising taste of what I'm sure will become one of the most well wrought shows of the year, as is the norm for HBO. Teased with mystery and the promise of a story worth hearing being told in a superb manner, Its hard not to fully recommend every mature adult checking this show out.The only demographic that wont be thoroughly satisfied with this work are people looking for lighter ""easy watching"" style programs. This isn't an episodic cop show, True Detective is dark and unapologetically twisted."
"True Detective","Silicone54","13 February 2024",NA,"First 15 minutes of episode 1 was pretty good and Jodie Foster is the lead? Yeah lets go!!! Well they went every which way with the entire story and even characters are all doing their own thing. Almost feels like they used different writers to handle each characters' plotlines and no one bothered to check if any of it makes sense.I watched every week and I cannot remember any names including the leads. Impossible to follow the story as they jump from major plot lines to another without any relevance to each other or continuity. I may just stop and wait until the season is complete so I can binge it. Perhaps watching episodes back to back will make it sink in. I love the True Detective series up until this one.I give season 4 a 2-star because of Jodie Foster but honestly she's not convincing at all in her role."
"True Detective","mathomas-28053","2 February 2024",NA,"Season 4 (Night Country)
There are many positive reviews for Jody Foster's ""Night Country."" I cannot imagine we are watching the same thing. I have recently watched the first three seasons of True Detective, and found them all to be very good or excellent. The mysteries were good and complicated. The acting and direction were good. The screenplays were excellent, full of wit, innuendo, plot revealed piece by piece, some wonderful lines of dialogue. Even the minor characters were interested and well-acted.This fourth season is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Nothing about the plot is interesting. None of the characters is interesting. There has not been one witty or memorable line of dialog. I can barely drag myself to watch the next episode. Extremely disappointing.Obviously, this could be a gender difference. The first three seasons were written by guys, about guys, and I am a guy. This fourth season is written by a woman, and stars female detectives. But I have seen PLENTY of excellent detective shows written by and starring women (mostly European) and loved them. So I don't think it's that.I don't know what you people are watching who are giving this fourth season high ratings. I'd rather watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" than suffer through this Alaskan nightmare. Also, I don't approve of bringing supernatural stuff into a detective show, if that's what this is going to turn out to be. Murder is not done by ghosts and spirits, it is done by murderers. I honestly believe these high ratings have been bought and paid for."

And he usually steals any scene not nailed down.But Matthew McConaughey operates at such a level here -- not to mention the astonishing makeup which makes him appear to be playing his own father -- that he walks off with this production.

"True Detective","DiCaprioFan1","30 September 2022",NA,"The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2)."
"True Detective","ksgillihan","6 February 2023",NA,"Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough."
"True Detective","gogoschka-1","13 January 2014",NA,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"True Detective","grantss","10 August 2015",NA,"(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3Â½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10."
"True Detective","Tweekums","23 March 2020",NA,"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."

I'm not saying it's the best show I've ever seen but it's on the list!"
"True Detective","loganschainker","7 July 2022",NA,"True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall. However, True Detective Season 1 is undoubtedly a 10/10."
"True Detective","Funkaairo","16 February 2023",NA,"Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha."
"True Detective","redroominparis","14 January 2019",NA,"Slow paced but well acted, True Detective season 3 returns to its roots. Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface. The Cinematography and Score are fantastic, making for and eagerly anticipated re-do that erases the inadequacy of season 2."
"True Detective","mlynch5187","15 October 2015",NA,"Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. ""Hey, that's okay"" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like ""Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you"". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple."

It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichÃ©d murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10"
"True Detective","MK_Ultra_","30 January 2024",NA,"Being a fan of the first season, skipping the second after 2 episodes in (lousy season), and lukewarm on season 3 (was okay), I'm at the point where ""can millions of people be wrong?""Probably not, but just throwing that out there.Season 4, so far, through 3 episodes---for me---is a criminally overrated slog. Who is the protagonist? Why should we care about all the unknown ""soap opera-esque"" hangups between the characters as they develop? There is the element of being derivative hanging over this (hello, John Carpenter), but the element of tribal spiritualism and some inklings of supernatural elements weigh it down as much as they are possibly keeping this series afloat. Talking put of both sides of my mouth, but the trappings of a less than suitable tying up of loose ends is running out of time and space.It's goofy at times (the few scenes with CGI are laughably bad in 2023-2024), it's boring most of the time...but the ending of the episodes bring in the element of the next episode will reveal more, but after three episodes of that same approach, I feel a further letdown on the horizon.It's kind of a mess, bottom line, and the scatterbrained script is really getting hard to watch as it unfolds in slow motion.With that said, this is the halfway point I do believe. Episode 3 out of 6 and just waiting for something to happen.Tempering expectations because a lot of the legitimate nationally publicated reviewers that I normally trust seem to go cuckoo for cocoapuffs over their reviewable full season preview that got me back onboard, but subjective as it can be---and even some calling this more of a ""horror"" themed season, it's falling completely flat other than a few disturbing scenes and the element of what is yet to be revealed.Edited for end of season assessment after watching finale:Absolutely a mess. They ran out of budget or couldn't find an editor to come in and clear.said mess. This is and was a complete disaster of a season, and starting to wonder about the promotional material they ran about the time of the Superbowl, where they folled.the screen with review quote snippets, if those were for all of the MAX content or this series, because a little slight of hand marketing wise might have been in play to sell this crap to the masses.This one's a hard pass."
"True Detective","amappou-565-320033","25 April 2020",NA,"Season 1 True Detective, different actors, different story, different class....absolutely amazing.....the following seasons average in comparison."
"True Detective","danielcereto","2 March 2024",NA,"I really love true detective. Season 1 is one of the greatest shows of all time. Season 2&3 were acceptable even not for everyone. Then season 4, an authentic disaster. I don't know where to start but I'll try.First, the cast (Almost all women) does a really bad job. It is a mixture of bad acting and cheap soap opera feeling. But, to be clear, I have a huge respect to Jodie Foster (Clarice) , but here her acting skills are embarrassing. She is as cold as the supposed plastic ice (embarrassing too).Second, the story is bland, full of cliches and overall unbelievable. A wasted opportunity.So, if you love True Detective, do not watch this. If you love Jodie Foster, watch The Silence of the Lambs. And if you want a great show watch Fargo the first 3 seasons instead."
"True Detective","tomhg38","13 January 2014",NA,"This is a show which almost bathes in success before it's begun. With it's cast and their pedigree of work i cant see many people interested in this type of television not seeing it.Regardless the pilot grips you with non-linear suspense driven story telling. Vaguely some kind of serial killer murders young women in a ritualistic manner and our 2 protagonists catch the case. What follows is a tantalising taste of what I'm sure will become one of the most well wrought shows of the year, as is the norm for HBO. Teased with mystery and the promise of a story worth hearing being told in a superb manner, Its hard not to fully recommend every mature adult checking this show out.The only demographic that wont be thoroughly satisfied with this work are people looking for lighter ""easy watching"" style programs. This isn't an episodic cop show, True Detective is dark and unapologetically twisted."
"True Detective","Silicone54","13 February 2024",NA,"First 15 minutes of episode 1 was pretty good and Jodie Foster is the lead? Yeah lets go!!! Well they went every which way with the entire story and even characters are all doing their own thing. Almost feels like they used different writers to handle each characters' plotlines and no one bothered to check if any of it makes sense.I watched every week and I cannot remember any names including the leads. Impossible to follow the story as they jump from major plot lines to another without any relevance to each other or continuity. I may just stop and wait until the season is complete so I can binge it. Perhaps watching episodes back to back will make it sink in. I love the True Detective series up until this one.I give season 4 a 2-star because of Jodie Foster but honestly she's not convincing at all in her role."
"True Detective","mathomas-28053","2 February 2024",NA,"Season 4 (Night Country)
There are many positive reviews for Jody Foster's ""Night Country."" I cannot imagine we are watching the same thing. I have recently watched the first three seasons of True Detective, and found them all to be very good or excellent. The mysteries were good and complicated. The acting and direction were good. The screenplays were excellent, full of wit, innuendo, plot revealed piece by piece, some wonderful lines of dialogue. Even the minor characters were interested and well-acted.This fourth season is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Nothing about the plot is interesting. None of the characters is interesting. There has not been one witty or memorable line of dialog. I can barely drag myself to watch the next episode. Extremely disappointing.Obviously, this could be a gender difference. The first three seasons were written by guys, about guys, and I am a guy. This fourth season is written by a woman, and stars female detectives. But I have seen PLENTY of excellent detective shows written by and starring women (mostly European) and loved them. So I don't think it's that.I don't know what you people are watching who are giving this fourth season high ratings. I'd rather watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" than suffer through this Alaskan nightmare. Also, I don't approve of bringing supernatural stuff into a detective show, if that's what this is going to turn out to be. Murder is not done by ghosts and spirits, it is done by murderers. I honestly believe these high ratings have been bought and paid for."

He does crazy better than crazy people. And he usually steals any scene not nailed down.But Matthew McConaughey operates at such a level here -- not to mention the astonishing makeup which makes him appear to be playing his own father -- that he walks off with this production. Mesmerizing.Everyone is pitch perfect, which I believe explains the casting awards.

"True Detective","DiCaprioFan1","30 September 2022",NA,"The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2)."
"True Detective","ksgillihan","6 February 2023",NA,"Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough."
"True Detective","gogoschka-1","13 January 2014",NA,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"True Detective","grantss","10 August 2015",NA,"(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3Â½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10."
"True Detective","Tweekums","23 March 2020",NA,"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."

Season 2, even though it had an amazing cast, was not that good at all & Season 3 was better and absolutely worth watching! There has never been nothing like Season 1 in the history of TV. I'm not saying it's the best show I've ever seen but it's on the list!"
"True Detective","loganschainker","7 July 2022",NA,"True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall. However, True Detective Season 1 is undoubtedly a 10/10."
"True Detective","Funkaairo","16 February 2023",NA,"Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha."
"True Detective","redroominparis","14 January 2019",NA,"Slow paced but well acted, True Detective season 3 returns to its roots. Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface. The Cinematography and Score are fantastic, making for and eagerly anticipated re-do that erases the inadequacy of season 2."
"True Detective","mlynch5187","15 October 2015",NA,"Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. ""Hey, that's okay"" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like ""Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you"". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple."
"True Detective","TomatoesareRotten","21 February 2024",NA,"It's done exactly what the second calamitous series did to the original premise , ruined the whole stock it had re garnered in series 3 ! One step forward two steps back ? The first two episodes set out on a fixed trajectory ( with some arbitrary and random family nonsense for good measure and NO it didn't help with character development ) but then went off ( no pun intended ) on several different paths, one of which was the utterly pointless inclusion of Christopher Eccleston and THAT side story. These deviations only contributed confusion and frustration for the viewer as the main story was, by now, being diluted to the point of insignificance ?! The last episode was some of the poorest storytelling and dialogue I've ever witnessed and it had Jodie Foster contributing her fair share of the nonsense unfolding. Breathtakingly bad, it even made Alaska look terrible and that's quite a feat."
"True Detective","paiello-44319","21 February 2024",NA,"A lot of thoughts, and most of them not good regarding this series of six episodes. The acting was fine, Jody Foster is always fantastic and so was the actress that played Navarro. It was very clichÃ© and that includes the characters and the plot. Seems like they were using the momentum from the previous seasons, which were highly acclaimed. One of those series you kept saying, who is this person again? Or what was the plot again? Most of the violence and murders coming from the good guys, senseless, revenge killings. There were some nonsensical moments as well. People falling through ice after we see Alaska in total darkness with frigid freezing, cold temperatures - the ice would definitely be several feet thick. Anyway there were some threads of high quality acting, but I gave this a score of six and that was generous.My suggestion? Skip season four of the series. I think season one is still regarded as the best. If you want to watch a series that's in the same genre. Watch Fargo season five. Really good stuff."

Talking put of both sides of my mouth, but the trappings of a less than suitable tying up of loose ends is running out of time and space.It's goofy at times (the few scenes with CGI are laughably bad in 2023-2024), it's boring most of the time...but the ending of the episodes bring in the element of the next episode will reveal more, but after three episodes of that same approach, I feel a further letdown on the horizon.It's kind of a mess, bottom line, and the scatterbrained script is really getting hard to watch as it unfolds in slow motion.With that said, this is the halfway point I do believe. Episode 3 out of 6 and just waiting for something to happen.Tempering expectations because a lot of the legitimate nationally publicated reviewers that I normally trust seem to go cuckoo for cocoapuffs over their reviewable full season preview that got me back onboard, but subjective as it can be---and even some calling this more of a ""horror"" themed season, it's falling completely flat other than a few disturbing scenes and the element of what is yet to be revealed.Edited for end of season assessment after watching finale:Absolutely a mess. They ran out of budget or couldn't find an editor to come in and clear.said mess. This is and was a complete disaster of a season, and starting to wonder about the promotional material they ran about the time of the Superbowl, where they folled.the screen with review quote snippets, if those were for all of the MAX content or this series, because a little slight of hand marketing wise might have been in play to sell this crap to the masses.This one's a hard pass."

Well they went every which way with the entire story and even characters are all doing their own thing. Almost feels like they used different writers to handle each characters' plotlines and no one bothered to check if any of it makes sense.I watched every week and I cannot remember any names including the leads. Impossible to follow the story as they jump from major plot lines to another without any relevance to each other or continuity. I may just stop and wait until the season is complete so I can binge it. Perhaps watching episodes back to back will make it sink in. I love the True Detective series up until this one.I give season 4 a 2-star because of Jodie Foster but honestly she's not convincing at all in her role."
"True Detective","mathomas-28053","2 February 2024",NA,"Season 4 (Night Country)
There are many positive reviews for Jody Foster's ""Night Country."" I cannot imagine we are watching the same thing. I have recently watched the first three seasons of True Detective, and found them all to be very good or excellent. The mysteries were good and complicated. The acting and direction were good. The screenplays were excellent, full of wit, innuendo, plot revealed piece by piece, some wonderful lines of dialogue. Even the minor characters were interested and well-acted.This fourth season is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Nothing about the plot is interesting. None of the characters is interesting. There has not been one witty or memorable line of dialog. I can barely drag myself to watch the next episode. Extremely disappointing.Obviously, this could be a gender difference. The first three seasons were written by guys, about guys, and I am a guy. This fourth season is written by a woman, and stars female detectives. But I have seen PLENTY of excellent detective shows written by and starring women (mostly European) and loved them. So I don't think it's that.I don't know what you people are watching who are giving this fourth season high ratings. I'd rather watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" than suffer through this Alaskan nightmare. Also, I don't approve of bringing supernatural stuff into a detective show, if that's what this is going to turn out to be. Murder is not done by ghosts and spirits, it is done by murderers. I honestly believe these high ratings have been bought and paid for."

He does crazy better than crazy people. And he usually steals any scene not nailed down.But Matthew McConaughey operates at such a level here -- not to mention the astonishing makeup which makes him appear to be playing his own father -- that he walks off with this production. Mesmerizing.Everyone is pitch perfect, which I believe explains the casting awards.

"True Detective","DiCaprioFan1","30 September 2022",NA,"The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2)."
"True Detective","ksgillihan","6 February 2023",NA,"Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough."
"True Detective","gogoschka-1","13 January 2014",NA,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"True Detective","grantss","10 August 2015",NA,"(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3Â½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10."
"True Detective","Tweekums","23 March 2020",NA,"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."

"True Detective","normaxjean-23753","20 July 2022",NA,"Season 1 still remains the greatest television I've ever seen. McConaughey's best performance to date and Harrelson goes toe-to-toe with him.

"True Detective","Supermanfan-13","24 February 2021",NA,"True Detective was an absolutely incredible crime series! Like most others here have already said...this is mostly based off Season 1. Season 2, even though it had an amazing cast, was not that good at all & Season 3 was better and absolutely worth watching! There has never been nothing like Season 1 in the history of TV. I'm not saying it's the best show I've ever seen but it's on the list!"
"True Detective","loganschainker","7 July 2022",NA,"True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall. However, True Detective Season 1 is undoubtedly a 10/10."
"True Detective","Funkaairo","16 February 2023",NA,"Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha."
"True Detective","redroominparis","14 January 2019",NA,"Slow paced but well acted, True Detective season 3 returns to its roots. Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface. The Cinematography and Score are fantastic, making for and eagerly anticipated re-do that erases the inadequacy of season 2."
"True Detective","mlynch5187","15 October 2015",NA,"Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. ""Hey, that's okay"" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like ""Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you"". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple."
"True Detective","TomatoesareRotten","21 February 2024",NA,"It's done exactly what the second calamitous series did to the original premise , ruined the whole stock it had re garnered in series 3 ! One step forward two steps back ? The first two episodes set out on a fixed trajectory ( with some arbitrary and random family nonsense for good measure and NO it didn't help with character development ) but then went off ( no pun intended ) on several different paths, one of which was the utterly pointless inclusion of Christopher Eccleston and THAT side story. These deviations only contributed confusion and frustration for the viewer as the main story was, by now, being diluted to the point of insignificance ?! The last episode was some of the poorest storytelling and dialogue I've ever witnessed and it had Jodie Foster contributing her fair share of the nonsense unfolding. Breathtakingly bad, it even made Alaska look terrible and that's quite a feat."
"True Detective","paiello-44319","21 February 2024",NA,"A lot of thoughts, and most of them not good regarding this series of six episodes. The acting was fine, Jody Foster is always fantastic and so was the actress that played Navarro. It was very clichÃ© and that includes the characters and the plot. Seems like they were using the momentum from the previous seasons, which were highly acclaimed. One of those series you kept saying, who is this person again? Or what was the plot again? Most of the violence and murders coming from the good guys, senseless, revenge killings. There were some nonsensical moments as well. People falling through ice after we see Alaska in total darkness with frigid freezing, cold temperatures - the ice would definitely be several feet thick. Anyway there were some threads of high quality acting, but I gave this a score of six and that was generous.My suggestion? Skip season four of the series. I think season one is still regarded as the best. If you want to watch a series that's in the same genre. Watch Fargo season five. Really good stuff."

Vince Vaughan seems to always carry the can for this seasons issues but they were far larger than one man. I was astounded how bad the second was to the first. The third season, I watched it, I can't remember it. Other than to say it was better than the stinker in the middle."
"True Detective","prabhat_kataria","13 January 2014",NA,"When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichÃ©d murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10"

"True Detective","Silicone54","13 February 2024",NA,"First 15 minutes of episode 1 was pretty good and Jodie Foster is the lead? Yeah lets go!!! Well they went every which way with the entire story and even characters are all doing their own thing. Almost feels like they used different writers to handle each characters' plotlines and no one bothered to check if any of it makes sense.I watched every week and I cannot remember any names including the leads. Impossible to follow the story as they jump from major plot lines to another without any relevance to each other or continuity. I may just stop and wait until the season is complete so I can binge it. Perhaps watching episodes back to back will make it sink in. I love the True Detective series up until this one.I give season 4 a 2-star because of Jodie Foster but honestly she's not convincing at all in her role."
"True Detective","mathomas-28053","2 February 2024",NA,"Season 4 (Night Country)
There are many positive reviews for Jody Foster's ""Night Country."" I cannot imagine we are watching the same thing. I have recently watched the first three seasons of True Detective, and found them all to be very good or excellent. The mysteries were good and complicated. The acting and direction were good. The screenplays were excellent, full of wit, innuendo, plot revealed piece by piece, some wonderful lines of dialogue. Even the minor characters were interested and well-acted.This fourth season is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Nothing about the plot is interesting. None of the characters is interesting. There has not been one witty or memorable line of dialog. I can barely drag myself to watch the next episode. Extremely disappointing.Obviously, this could be a gender difference. The first three seasons were written by guys, about guys, and I am a guy. This fourth season is written by a woman, and stars female detectives. But I have seen PLENTY of excellent detective shows written by and starring women (mostly European) and loved them. So I don't think it's that.I don't know what you people are watching who are giving this fourth season high ratings. I'd rather watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" than suffer through this Alaskan nightmare. Also, I don't approve of bringing supernatural stuff into a detective show, if that's what this is going to turn out to be. Murder is not done by ghosts and spirits, it is done by murderers. I honestly believe these high ratings have been bought and paid for."

"True Detective","DiCaprioFan1","30 September 2022",NA,"The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2)."
"True Detective","ksgillihan","6 February 2023",NA,"Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough."
"True Detective","gogoschka-1","13 January 2014",NA,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"True Detective","grantss","10 August 2015",NA,"(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3Â½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10."
"True Detective","Tweekums","23 March 2020",NA,"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."
"True Detective","ricochet93-369-308802","4 January 2019",NA,"Season one is a beautiful thing.Then Vince Vaughan happened and the less said about that the better."
"True Detective","normaxjean-23753","20 July 2022",NA,"Season 1 still remains the greatest television I've ever seen. McConaughey's best performance to date and Harrelson goes toe-to-toe with him. Everything from the acting (including every minor character) to the writing to the cinematography to the score is phenomenal."
"True Detective","Supermanfan-13","24 February 2021",NA,"True Detective was an absolutely incredible crime series! Like most others here have already said...this is mostly based off Season 1. Season 2, even though it had an amazing cast, was not that good at all & Season 3 was better and absolutely worth watching! There has never been nothing like Season 1 in the history of TV. I'm not saying it's the best show I've ever seen but it's on the list!"
"True Detective","loganschainker","7 July 2022",NA,"True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall. However, True Detective Season 1 is undoubtedly a 10/10."
"True Detective","Funkaairo","16 February 2023",NA,"Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha."
"True Detective","redroominparis","14 January 2019",NA,"Slow paced but well acted, True Detective season 3 returns to its roots. Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface. The Cinematography and Score are fantastic, making for and eagerly anticipated re-do that erases the inadequacy of season 2."
"True Detective","mlynch5187","15 October 2015",NA,"Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. ""Hey, that's okay"" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like ""Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you"". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple."
"True Detective","TomatoesareRotten","21 February 2024",NA,"It's done exactly what the second calamitous series did to the original premise , ruined the whole stock it had re garnered in series 3 ! One step forward two steps back ? The first two episodes set out on a fixed trajectory ( with some arbitrary and random family nonsense for good measure and NO it didn't help with character development ) but then went off ( no pun intended ) on several different paths, one of which was the utterly pointless inclusion of Christopher Eccleston and THAT side story. These deviations only contributed confusion and frustration for the viewer as the main story was, by now, being diluted to the point of insignificance ?! The last episode was some of the poorest storytelling and dialogue I've ever witnessed and it had Jodie Foster contributing her fair share of the nonsense unfolding. Breathtakingly bad, it even made Alaska look terrible and that's quite a feat."
"True Detective","paiello-44319","21 February 2024",NA,"A lot of thoughts, and most of them not good regarding this series of six episodes. The acting was fine, Jody Foster is always fantastic and so was the actress that played Navarro. It was very clichÃ© and that includes the characters and the plot. Seems like they were using the momentum from the previous seasons, which were highly acclaimed. One of those series you kept saying, who is this person again? Or what was the plot again? Most of the violence and murders coming from the good guys, senseless, revenge killings. There were some nonsensical moments as well. People falling through ice after we see Alaska in total darkness with frigid freezing, cold temperatures - the ice would definitely be several feet thick. Anyway there were some threads of high quality acting, but I gave this a score of six and that was generous.My suggestion? Skip season four of the series. I think season one is still regarded as the best. If you want to watch a series that's in the same genre. Watch Fargo season five. Really good stuff."
"True Detective","sammybeno","23 January 2021",NA,"Season 1 of True Detective may be the best television I've ever seen. Its written brilliantly and has some of the best performances I've ever witnessed with Woody and Matthew. They were robbed by not winning an Emmy or Golden Globe."

Vince Vaughan seems to always carry the can for this seasons issues but they were far larger than one man. I was astounded how bad the second was to the first. The third season, I watched it, I can't remember it. Other than to say it was better than the stinker in the middle."
"True Detective","prabhat_kataria","13 January 2014",NA,"When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichÃ©d murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10"
"True Detective","MK_Ultra_","30 January 2024",NA,"Being a fan of the first season, skipping the second after 2 episodes in (lousy season), and lukewarm on season 3 (was okay), I'm at the point where ""can millions of people be wrong?""Probably not, but just throwing that out there.Season 4, so far, through 3 episodes---for me---is a criminally overrated slog. Who is the protagonist? Why should we care about all the unknown ""soap opera-esque"" hangups between the characters as they develop? There is the element of being derivative hanging over this (hello, John Carpenter), but the element of tribal spiritualism and some inklings of supernatural elements weigh it down as much as they are possibly keeping this series afloat. Talking put of both sides of my mouth, but the trappings of a less than suitable tying up of loose ends is running out of time and space.It's goofy at times (the few scenes with CGI are laughably bad in 2023-2024), it's boring most of the time...but the ending of the episodes bring in the element of the next episode will reveal more, but after three episodes of that same approach, I feel a further letdown on the horizon.It's kind of a mess, bottom line, and the scatterbrained script is really getting hard to watch as it unfolds in slow motion.With that said, this is the halfway point I do believe. Episode 3 out of 6 and just waiting for something to happen.Tempering expectations because a lot of the legitimate nationally publicated reviewers that I normally trust seem to go cuckoo for cocoapuffs over their reviewable full season preview that got me back onboard, but subjective as it can be---and even some calling this more of a ""horror"" themed season, it's falling completely flat other than a few disturbing scenes and the element of what is yet to be revealed.Edited for end of season assessment after watching finale:Absolutely a mess. They ran out of budget or couldn't find an editor to come in and clear.said mess. This is and was a complete disaster of a season, and starting to wonder about the promotional material they ran about the time of the Superbowl, where they folled.the screen with review quote snippets, if those were for all of the MAX content or this series, because a little slight of hand marketing wise might have been in play to sell this crap to the masses.This one's a hard pass."

She is as cold as the supposed plastic ice (embarrassing too).Second, the story is bland, full of cliches and overall unbelievable.

"True Detective","DiCaprioFan1","30 September 2022",NA,"The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2)."
"True Detective","ksgillihan","6 February 2023",NA,"Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough."
"True Detective","gogoschka-1","13 January 2014",NA,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"True Detective","grantss","10 August 2015",NA,"(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3Â½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10."
"True Detective","Tweekums","23 March 2020",NA,"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."
"True Detective","ricochet93-369-308802","4 January 2019",NA,"Season one is a beautiful thing.Then Vince Vaughan happened and the less said about that the better."
"True Detective","normaxjean-23753","20 July 2022",NA,"Season 1 still remains the greatest television I've ever seen. McConaughey's best performance to date and Harrelson goes toe-to-toe with him. Everything from the acting (including every minor character) to the writing to the cinematography to the score is phenomenal."
"True Detective","Supermanfan-13","24 February 2021",NA,"True Detective was an absolutely incredible crime series! Like most others here have already said...this is mostly based off Season 1. Season 2, even though it had an amazing cast, was not that good at all & Season 3 was better and absolutely worth watching! There has never been nothing like Season 1 in the history of TV. I'm not saying it's the best show I've ever seen but it's on the list!"
"True Detective","loganschainker","7 July 2022",NA,"True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall. However, True Detective Season 1 is undoubtedly a 10/10."
"True Detective","Funkaairo","16 February 2023",NA,"Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha."
"True Detective","redroominparis","14 January 2019",NA,"Slow paced but well acted, True Detective season 3 returns to its roots. Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface. The Cinematography and Score are fantastic, making for and eagerly anticipated re-do that erases the inadequacy of season 2."
"True Detective","mlynch5187","15 October 2015",NA,"Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. ""Hey, that's okay"" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like ""Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you"". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple."
"True Detective","TomatoesareRotten","21 February 2024",NA,"It's done exactly what the second calamitous series did to the original premise , ruined the whole stock it had re garnered in series 3 ! One step forward two steps back ? The first two episodes set out on a fixed trajectory ( with some arbitrary and random family nonsense for good measure and NO it didn't help with character development ) but then went off ( no pun intended ) on several different paths, one of which was the utterly pointless inclusion of Christopher Eccleston and THAT side story. These deviations only contributed confusion and frustration for the viewer as the main story was, by now, being diluted to the point of insignificance ?! The last episode was some of the poorest storytelling and dialogue I've ever witnessed and it had Jodie Foster contributing her fair share of the nonsense unfolding. Breathtakingly bad, it even made Alaska look terrible and that's quite a feat."
"True Detective","paiello-44319","21 February 2024",NA,"A lot of thoughts, and most of them not good regarding this series of six episodes. The acting was fine, Jody Foster is always fantastic and so was the actress that played Navarro. It was very clichÃ© and that includes the characters and the plot. Seems like they were using the momentum from the previous seasons, which were highly acclaimed. One of those series you kept saying, who is this person again? Or what was the plot again? Most of the violence and murders coming from the good guys, senseless, revenge killings. There were some nonsensical moments as well. People falling through ice after we see Alaska in total darkness with frigid freezing, cold temperatures - the ice would definitely be several feet thick. Anyway there were some threads of high quality acting, but I gave this a score of six and that was generous.My suggestion? Skip season four of the series. I think season one is still regarded as the best. If you want to watch a series that's in the same genre. Watch Fargo season five. Really good stuff."
"True Detective","sammybeno","23 January 2021",NA,"Season 1 of True Detective may be the best television I've ever seen. Its written brilliantly and has some of the best performances I've ever witnessed with Woody and Matthew. They were robbed by not winning an Emmy or Golden Globe."
"True Detective","bsamad-50088","22 November 2019",NA,"I only rated 9 because i didn't like season 2 that much , but season 1 and 3 are just a masterpieces !!

"True Detective","ladnerlowery","30 March 2021",NA,"I watched season 1 again last week and I am still in awe of every element of this masterpiece. The pace, the acting, everything is so perfect it is mindblowing. I remember the excitement of waiting for season 2, which evaporated after episode 1. Vince Vaughan seems to always carry the can for this seasons issues but they were far larger than one man. I was astounded how bad the second was to the first. The third season, I watched it, I can't remember it. Other than to say it was better than the stinker in the middle."
"True Detective","prabhat_kataria","13 January 2014",NA,"When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichÃ©d murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10"
"True Detective","MK_Ultra_","30 January 2024",NA,"Being a fan of the first season, skipping the second after 2 episodes in (lousy season), and lukewarm on season 3 (was okay), I'm at the point where ""can millions of people be wrong?""Probably not, but just throwing that out there.Season 4, so far, through 3 episodes---for me---is a criminally overrated slog. Who is the protagonist? Why should we care about all the unknown ""soap opera-esque"" hangups between the characters as they develop? There is the element of being derivative hanging over this (hello, John Carpenter), but the element of tribal spiritualism and some inklings of supernatural elements weigh it down as much as they are possibly keeping this series afloat. Talking put of both sides of my mouth, but the trappings of a less than suitable tying up of loose ends is running out of time and space.It's goofy at times (the few scenes with CGI are laughably bad in 2023-2024), it's boring most of the time...but the ending of the episodes bring in the element of the next episode will reveal more, but after three episodes of that same approach, I feel a further letdown on the horizon.It's kind of a mess, bottom line, and the scatterbrained script is really getting hard to watch as it unfolds in slow motion.With that said, this is the halfway point I do believe. Episode 3 out of 6 and just waiting for something to happen.Tempering expectations because a lot of the legitimate nationally publicated reviewers that I normally trust seem to go cuckoo for cocoapuffs over their reviewable full season preview that got me back onboard, but subjective as it can be---and even some calling this more of a ""horror"" themed season, it's falling completely flat other than a few disturbing scenes and the element of what is yet to be revealed.Edited for end of season assessment after watching finale:Absolutely a mess. They ran out of budget or couldn't find an editor to come in and clear.said mess. This is and was a complete disaster of a season, and starting to wonder about the promotional material they ran about the time of the Superbowl, where they folled.the screen with review quote snippets, if those were for all of the MAX content or this series, because a little slight of hand marketing wise might have been in play to sell this crap to the masses.This one's a hard pass."
"True Detective","amappou-565-320033","25 April 2020",NA,"Season 1 True Detective, different actors, different story, different class....absolutely amazing.....the following seasons average in comparison."
"True Detective","danielcereto","2 March 2024",NA,"I really love true detective. Season 1 is one of the greatest shows of all time. Season 2&3 were acceptable even not for everyone. Then season 4, an authentic disaster. I don't know where to start but I'll try.First, the cast (Almost all women) does a really bad job. It is a mixture of bad acting and cheap soap opera feeling. But, to be clear, I have a huge respect to Jodie Foster (Clarice) , but here her acting skills are embarrassing. She is as cold as the supposed plastic ice (embarrassing too).Second, the story is bland, full of cliches and overall unbelievable. A wasted opportunity.So, if you love True Detective, do not watch this. If you love Jodie Foster, watch The Silence of the Lambs. And if you want a great show watch Fargo the first 3 seasons instead."
"True Detective","tomhg38","13 January 2014",NA,"This is a show which almost bathes in success before it's begun. With it's cast and their pedigree of work i cant see many people interested in this type of television not seeing it.Regardless the pilot grips you with non-linear suspense driven story telling. Vaguely some kind of serial killer murders young women in a ritualistic manner and our 2 protagonists catch the case. What follows is a tantalising taste of what I'm sure will become one of the most well wrought shows of the year, as is the norm for HBO. Teased with mystery and the promise of a story worth hearing being told in a superb manner, Its hard not to fully recommend every mature adult checking this show out.The only demographic that wont be thoroughly satisfied with this work are people looking for lighter ""easy watching"" style programs. This isn't an episodic cop show, True Detective is dark and unapologetically twisted."
"True Detective","Silicone54","13 February 2024",NA,"First 15 minutes of episode 1 was pretty good and Jodie Foster is the lead? Yeah lets go!!! Well they went every which way with the entire story and even characters are all doing their own thing. Almost feels like they used different writers to handle each characters' plotlines and no one bothered to check if any of it makes sense.I watched every week and I cannot remember any names including the leads. Impossible to follow the story as they jump from major plot lines to another without any relevance to each other or continuity. I may just stop and wait until the season is complete so I can binge it. Perhaps watching episodes back to back will make it sink in. I love the True Detective series up until this one.I give season 4 a 2-star because of Jodie Foster but honestly she's not convincing at all in her role."
"True Detective","mathomas-28053","2 February 2024",NA,"Season 4 (Night Country)
There are many positive reviews for Jody Foster's ""Night Country."" I cannot imagine we are watching the same thing. I have recently watched the first three seasons of True Detective, and found them all to be very good or excellent. The mysteries were good and complicated. The acting and direction were good. The screenplays were excellent, full of wit, innuendo, plot revealed piece by piece, some wonderful lines of dialogue. Even the minor characters were interested and well-acted.This fourth season is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Nothing about the plot is interesting. None of the characters is interesting. There has not been one witty or memorable line of dialog. I can barely drag myself to watch the next episode. Extremely disappointing.Obviously, this could be a gender difference. The first three seasons were written by guys, about guys, and I am a guy. This fourth season is written by a woman, and stars female detectives. But I have seen PLENTY of excellent detective shows written by and starring women (mostly European) and loved them. So I don't think it's that.I don't know what you people are watching who are giving this fourth season high ratings. I'd rather watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" than suffer through this Alaskan nightmare. Also, I don't approve of bringing supernatural stuff into a detective show, if that's what this is going to turn out to be. Murder is not done by ghosts and spirits, it is done by murderers. I honestly believe these high ratings have been bought and paid for."

Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023.

"True Detective","gogoschka-1","13 January 2014",NA,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"True Detective","grantss","10 August 2015",NA,"(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3Â½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10."
"True Detective","Tweekums","23 March 2020",NA,"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."
"True Detective","ricochet93-369-308802","4 January 2019",NA,"Season one is a beautiful thing.Then Vince Vaughan happened and the less said about that the better."
"True Detective","normaxjean-23753","20 July 2022",NA,"Season 1 still remains the greatest television I've ever seen. McConaughey's best performance to date and Harrelson goes toe-to-toe with him. Everything from the acting (including every minor character) to the writing to the cinematography to the score is phenomenal."
"True Detective","Supermanfan-13","24 February 2021",NA,"True Detective was an absolutely incredible crime series! Like most others here have already said...this is mostly based off Season 1. Season 2, even though it had an amazing cast, was not that good at all & Season 3 was better and absolutely worth watching! There has never been nothing like Season 1 in the history of TV. I'm not saying it's the best show I've ever seen but it's on the list!"
"True Detective","loganschainker","7 July 2022",NA,"True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall. However, True Detective Season 1 is undoubtedly a 10/10."
"True Detective","Funkaairo","16 February 2023",NA,"Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha."
"True Detective","redroominparis","14 January 2019",NA,"Slow paced but well acted, True Detective season 3 returns to its roots. Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface. The Cinematography and Score are fantastic, making for and eagerly anticipated re-do that erases the inadequacy of season 2."
"True Detective","mlynch5187","15 October 2015",NA,"Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. ""Hey, that's okay"" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like ""Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you"". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple."
"True Detective","TomatoesareRotten","21 February 2024",NA,"It's done exactly what the second calamitous series did to the original premise , ruined the whole stock it had re garnered in series 3 ! One step forward two steps back ? The first two episodes set out on a fixed trajectory ( with some arbitrary and random family nonsense for good measure and NO it didn't help with character development ) but then went off ( no pun intended ) on several different paths, one of which was the utterly pointless inclusion of Christopher Eccleston and THAT side story. These deviations only contributed confusion and frustration for the viewer as the main story was, by now, being diluted to the point of insignificance ?! The last episode was some of the poorest storytelling and dialogue I've ever witnessed and it had Jodie Foster contributing her fair share of the nonsense unfolding. Breathtakingly bad, it even made Alaska look terrible and that's quite a feat."
"True Detective","paiello-44319","21 February 2024",NA,"A lot of thoughts, and most of them not good regarding this series of six episodes. The acting was fine, Jody Foster is always fantastic and so was the actress that played Navarro. It was very clichÃ© and that includes the characters and the plot. Seems like they were using the momentum from the previous seasons, which were highly acclaimed. One of those series you kept saying, who is this person again? Or what was the plot again? Most of the violence and murders coming from the good guys, senseless, revenge killings. There were some nonsensical moments as well. People falling through ice after we see Alaska in total darkness with frigid freezing, cold temperatures - the ice would definitely be several feet thick. Anyway there were some threads of high quality acting, but I gave this a score of six and that was generous.My suggestion? Skip season four of the series. I think season one is still regarded as the best. If you want to watch a series that's in the same genre. Watch Fargo season five. Really good stuff."
"True Detective","sammybeno","23 January 2021",NA,"Season 1 of True Detective may be the best television I've ever seen. Its written brilliantly and has some of the best performances I've ever witnessed with Woody and Matthew. They were robbed by not winning an Emmy or Golden Globe."
"True Detective","bsamad-50088","22 November 2019",NA,"I only rated 9 because i didn't like season 2 that much , but season 1 and 3 are just a masterpieces !! Specially the acting of Matthew and Ali , the story and the script , the atmosphere they created in this show is attractive ,i fell in love with the show , one of the best i ever seen"
"True Detective","ladnerlowery","30 March 2021",NA,"I watched season 1 again last week and I am still in awe of every element of this masterpiece. The pace, the acting, everything is so perfect it is mindblowing. I remember the excitement of waiting for season 2, which evaporated after episode 1. Vince Vaughan seems to always carry the can for this seasons issues but they were far larger than one man. I was astounded how bad the second was to the first. The third season, I watched it, I can't remember it. Other than to say it was better than the stinker in the middle."
"True Detective","prabhat_kataria","13 January 2014",NA,"When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichÃ©d murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10"
"True Detective","MK_Ultra_","30 January 2024",NA,"Being a fan of the first season, skipping the second after 2 episodes in (lousy season), and lukewarm on season 3 (was okay), I'm at the point where ""can millions of people be wrong?""Probably not, but just throwing that out there.Season 4, so far, through 3 episodes---for me---is a criminally overrated slog. Who is the protagonist? Why should we care about all the unknown ""soap opera-esque"" hangups between the characters as they develop? There is the element of being derivative hanging over this (hello, John Carpenter), but the element of tribal spiritualism and some inklings of supernatural elements weigh it down as much as they are possibly keeping this series afloat. Talking put of both sides of my mouth, but the trappings of a less than suitable tying up of loose ends is running out of time and space.It's goofy at times (the few scenes with CGI are laughably bad in 2023-2024), it's boring most of the time...but the ending of the episodes bring in the element of the next episode will reveal more, but after three episodes of that same approach, I feel a further letdown on the horizon.It's kind of a mess, bottom line, and the scatterbrained script is really getting hard to watch as it unfolds in slow motion.With that said, this is the halfway point I do believe. Episode 3 out of 6 and just waiting for something to happen.Tempering expectations because a lot of the legitimate nationally publicated reviewers that I normally trust seem to go cuckoo for cocoapuffs over their reviewable full season preview that got me back onboard, but subjective as it can be---and even some calling this more of a ""horror"" themed season, it's falling completely flat other than a few disturbing scenes and the element of what is yet to be revealed.Edited for end of season assessment after watching finale:Absolutely a mess. They ran out of budget or couldn't find an editor to come in and clear.said mess. This is and was a complete disaster of a season, and starting to wonder about the promotional material they ran about the time of the Superbowl, where they folled.the screen with review quote snippets, if those were for all of the MAX content or this series, because a little slight of hand marketing wise might have been in play to sell this crap to the masses.This one's a hard pass."
"True Detective","amappou-565-320033","25 April 2020",NA,"Season 1 True Detective, different actors, different story, different class....absolutely amazing.....the following seasons average in comparison."
"True Detective","danielcereto","2 March 2024",NA,"I really love true detective. Season 1 is one of the greatest shows of all time. Season 2&3 were acceptable even not for everyone. Then season 4, an authentic disaster. I don't know where to start but I'll try.First, the cast (Almost all women) does a really bad job. It is a mixture of bad acting and cheap soap opera feeling. But, to be clear, I have a huge respect to Jodie Foster (Clarice) , but here her acting skills are embarrassing. She is as cold as the supposed plastic ice (embarrassing too).Second, the story is bland, full of cliches and overall unbelievable. A wasted opportunity.So, if you love True Detective, do not watch this. If you love Jodie Foster, watch The Silence of the Lambs. And if you want a great show watch Fargo the first 3 seasons instead."
"True Detective","tomhg38","13 January 2014",NA,"This is a show which almost bathes in success before it's begun. With it's cast and their pedigree of work i cant see many people interested in this type of television not seeing it.Regardless the pilot grips you with non-linear suspense driven story telling. Vaguely some kind of serial killer murders young women in a ritualistic manner and our 2 protagonists catch the case. What follows is a tantalising taste of what I'm sure will become one of the most well wrought shows of the year, as is the norm for HBO. Teased with mystery and the promise of a story worth hearing being told in a superb manner, Its hard not to fully recommend every mature adult checking this show out.The only demographic that wont be thoroughly satisfied with this work are people looking for lighter ""easy watching"" style programs. This isn't an episodic cop show, True Detective is dark and unapologetically twisted."
"True Detective","Silicone54","13 February 2024",NA,"First 15 minutes of episode 1 was pretty good and Jodie Foster is the lead? Yeah lets go!!! Well they went every which way with the entire story and even characters are all doing their own thing. Almost feels like they used different writers to handle each characters' plotlines and no one bothered to check if any of it makes sense.I watched every week and I cannot remember any names including the leads. Impossible to follow the story as they jump from major plot lines to another without any relevance to each other or continuity. I may just stop and wait until the season is complete so I can binge it. Perhaps watching episodes back to back will make it sink in. I love the True Detective series up until this one.I give season 4 a 2-star because of Jodie Foster but honestly she's not convincing at all in her role."
"True Detective","mathomas-28053","2 February 2024",NA,"Season 4 (Night Country)
There are many positive reviews for Jody Foster's ""Night Country."" I cannot imagine we are watching the same thing. I have recently watched the first three seasons of True Detective, and found them all to be very good or excellent. The mysteries were good and complicated. The acting and direction were good. The screenplays were excellent, full of wit, innuendo, plot revealed piece by piece, some wonderful lines of dialogue. Even the minor characters were interested and well-acted.This fourth season is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Nothing about the plot is interesting. None of the characters is interesting. There has not been one witty or memorable line of dialog. I can barely drag myself to watch the next episode. Extremely disappointing.Obviously, this could be a gender difference. The first three seasons were written by guys, about guys, and I am a guy. This fourth season is written by a woman, and stars female detectives. But I have seen PLENTY of excellent detective shows written by and starring women (mostly European) and loved them. So I don't think it's that.I don't know what you people are watching who are giving this fourth season high ratings. I'd rather watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" than suffer through this Alaskan nightmare. Also, I don't approve of bringing supernatural stuff into a detective show, if that's what this is going to turn out to be. Murder is not done by ghosts and spirits, it is done by murderers. I honestly believe these high ratings have been bought and paid for."

He does crazy better than crazy people. And he usually steals any scene not nailed down.But Matthew McConaughey operates at such a level here -- not to mention the astonishing makeup which makes him appear to be playing his own father -- that he walks off with this production. Mesmerizing.Everyone is pitch perfect, which I believe explains the casting awards.

"True Detective","DiCaprioFan1","30 September 2022",NA,"The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2)."
"True Detective","ksgillihan","6 February 2023",NA,"Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough."
"True Detective","gogoschka-1","13 January 2014",NA,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"True Detective","grantss","10 August 2015",NA,"(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great.

All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3Â½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10."
"True Detective","Tweekums","23 March 2020",NA,"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."

"True Detective","Supermanfan-13","24 February 2021",NA,"True Detective was an absolutely incredible crime series! Like most others here have already said...this is mostly based off Season 1. Season 2, even though it had an amazing cast, was not that good at all & Season 3 was better and absolutely worth watching! There has never been nothing like Season 1 in the history of TV. I'm not saying it's the best show I've ever seen but it's on the list!"
"True Detective","loganschainker","7 July 2022",NA,"True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall. However, True Detective Season 1 is undoubtedly a 10/10."
"True Detective","Funkaairo","16 February 2023",NA,"Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha."
"True Detective","redroominparis","14 January 2019",NA,"Slow paced but well acted, True Detective season 3 returns to its roots. Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface. The Cinematography and Score are fantastic, making for and eagerly anticipated re-do that erases the inadequacy of season 2."
"True Detective","mlynch5187","15 October 2015",NA,"Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. ""Hey, that's okay"" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like ""Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you"". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple."
"True Detective","TomatoesareRotten","21 February 2024",NA,"It's done exactly what the second calamitous series did to the original premise , ruined the whole stock it had re garnered in series 3 ! One step forward two steps back ? The first two episodes set out on a fixed trajectory ( with some arbitrary and random family nonsense for good measure and NO it didn't help with character development ) but then went off ( no pun intended ) on several different paths, one of which was the utterly pointless inclusion of Christopher Eccleston and THAT side story. These deviations only contributed confusion and frustration for the viewer as the main story was, by now, being diluted to the point of insignificance ?! The last episode was some of the poorest storytelling and dialogue I've ever witnessed and it had Jodie Foster contributing her fair share of the nonsense unfolding. Breathtakingly bad, it even made Alaska look terrible and that's quite a feat."
"True Detective","paiello-44319","21 February 2024",NA,"A lot of thoughts, and most of them not good regarding this series of six episodes. The acting was fine, Jody Foster is always fantastic and so was the actress that played Navarro. It was very clichÃ© and that includes the characters and the plot. Seems like they were using the momentum from the previous seasons, which were highly acclaimed. One of those series you kept saying, who is this person again? Or what was the plot again? Most of the violence and murders coming from the good guys, senseless, revenge killings. There were some nonsensical moments as well. People falling through ice after we see Alaska in total darkness with frigid freezing, cold temperatures - the ice would definitely be several feet thick. Anyway there were some threads of high quality acting, but I gave this a score of six and that was generous.My suggestion? Skip season four of the series. I think season one is still regarded as the best. If you want to watch a series that's in the same genre. Watch Fargo season five. Really good stuff."
"True Detective","sammybeno","23 January 2021",NA,"Season 1 of True Detective may be the best television I've ever seen. Its written brilliantly and has some of the best performances I've ever witnessed with Woody and Matthew. They were robbed by not winning an Emmy or Golden Globe."

"True Detective","ladnerlowery","30 March 2021",NA,"I watched season 1 again last week and I am still in awe of every element of this masterpiece. The pace, the acting, everything is so perfect it is mindblowing. I remember the excitement of waiting for season 2, which evaporated after episode 1. Vince Vaughan seems to always carry the can for this seasons issues but they were far larger than one man. I was astounded how bad the second was to the first. The third season, I watched it, I can't remember it. Other than to say it was better than the stinker in the middle."
"True Detective","prabhat_kataria","13 January 2014",NA,"When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichÃ©d murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10"
"True Detective","MK_Ultra_","30 January 2024",NA,"Being a fan of the first season, skipping the second after 2 episodes in (lousy season), and lukewarm on season 3 (was okay), I'm at the point where ""can millions of people be wrong?""Probably not, but just throwing that out there.Season 4, so far, through 3 episodes---for me---is a criminally overrated slog. Who is the protagonist? Why should we care about all the unknown ""soap opera-esque"" hangups between the characters as they develop? There is the element of being derivative hanging over this (hello, John Carpenter), but the element of tribal spiritualism and some inklings of supernatural elements weigh it down as much as they are possibly keeping this series afloat. Talking put of both sides of my mouth, but the trappings of a less than suitable tying up of loose ends is running out of time and space.It's goofy at times (the few scenes with CGI are laughably bad in 2023-2024), it's boring most of the time...but the ending of the episodes bring in the element of the next episode will reveal more, but after three episodes of that same approach, I feel a further letdown on the horizon.It's kind of a mess, bottom line, and the scatterbrained script is really getting hard to watch as it unfolds in slow motion.With that said, this is the halfway point I do believe. Episode 3 out of 6 and just waiting for something to happen.Tempering expectations because a lot of the legitimate nationally publicated reviewers that I normally trust seem to go cuckoo for cocoapuffs over their reviewable full season preview that got me back onboard, but subjective as it can be---and even some calling this more of a ""horror"" themed season, it's falling completely flat other than a few disturbing scenes and the element of what is yet to be revealed.Edited for end of season assessment after watching finale:Absolutely a mess. They ran out of budget or couldn't find an editor to come in and clear.said mess. This is and was a complete disaster of a season, and starting to wonder about the promotional material they ran about the time of the Superbowl, where they folled.the screen with review quote snippets, if those were for all of the MAX content or this series, because a little slight of hand marketing wise might have been in play to sell this crap to the masses.This one's a hard pass."

"True Detective","danielcereto","2 March 2024",NA,"I really love true detective. Season 1 is one of the greatest shows of all time. Season 2&3 were acceptable even not for everyone. Then season 4, an authentic disaster. I don't know where to start but I'll try.First, the cast (Almost all women) does a really bad job. It is a mixture of bad acting and cheap soap opera feeling. But, to be clear, I have a huge respect to Jodie Foster (Clarice) , but here her acting skills are embarrassing. She is as cold as the supposed plastic ice (embarrassing too).Second, the story is bland, full of cliches and overall unbelievable. A wasted opportunity.So, if you love True Detective, do not watch this. If you love Jodie Foster, watch The Silence of the Lambs. And if you want a great show watch Fargo the first 3 seasons instead."
"True Detective","tomhg38","13 January 2014",NA,"This is a show which almost bathes in success before it's begun. With it's cast and their pedigree of work i cant see many people interested in this type of television not seeing it.Regardless the pilot grips you with non-linear suspense driven story telling. Vaguely some kind of serial killer murders young women in a ritualistic manner and our 2 protagonists catch the case. What follows is a tantalising taste of what I'm sure will become one of the most well wrought shows of the year, as is the norm for HBO. Teased with mystery and the promise of a story worth hearing being told in a superb manner, Its hard not to fully recommend every mature adult checking this show out.The only demographic that wont be thoroughly satisfied with this work are people looking for lighter ""easy watching"" style programs. This isn't an episodic cop show, True Detective is dark and unapologetically twisted."

Well they went every which way with the entire story and even characters are all doing their own thing. Almost feels like they used different writers to handle each characters' plotlines and no one bothered to check if any of it makes sense.I watched every week and I cannot remember any names including the leads. Impossible to follow the story as they jump from major plot lines to another without any relevance to each other or continuity. I may just stop and wait until the season is complete so I can binge it. Perhaps watching episodes back to back will make it sink in. I love the True Detective series up until this one.I give season 4 a 2-star because of Jodie Foster but honestly she's not convincing at all in her role."
"True Detective","mathomas-28053","2 February 2024",NA,"Season 4 (Night Country)
There are many positive reviews for Jody Foster's ""Night Country."" I cannot imagine we are watching the same thing. I have recently watched the first three seasons of True Detective, and found them all to be very good or excellent. The mysteries were good and complicated. The acting and direction were good. The screenplays were excellent, full of wit, innuendo, plot revealed piece by piece, some wonderful lines of dialogue. Even the minor characters were interested and well-acted.This fourth season is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Nothing about the plot is interesting. None of the characters is interesting. There has not been one witty or memorable line of dialog. I can barely drag myself to watch the next episode. Extremely disappointing.Obviously, this could be a gender difference. The first three seasons were written by guys, about guys, and I am a guy. This fourth season is written by a woman, and stars female detectives. But I have seen PLENTY of excellent detective shows written by and starring women (mostly European) and loved them. So I don't think it's that.I don't know what you people are watching who are giving this fourth season high ratings. I'd rather watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" than suffer through this Alaskan nightmare. Also, I don't approve of bringing supernatural stuff into a detective show, if that's what this is going to turn out to be. Murder is not done by ghosts and spirits, it is done by murderers. I honestly believe these high ratings have been bought and paid for."

"True Detective","DiCaprioFan1","30 September 2022",NA,"The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2)."
"True Detective","ksgillihan","6 February 2023",NA,"Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough."
"True Detective","gogoschka-1","13 January 2014",NA,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"True Detective","grantss","10 August 2015",NA,"(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3Â½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10."
"True Detective","Tweekums","23 March 2020",NA,"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."

Season 2, even though it had an amazing cast, was not that good at all & Season 3 was better and absolutely worth watching! There has never been nothing like Season 1 in the history of TV. I'm not saying it's the best show I've ever seen but it's on the list!"
"True Detective","loganschainker","7 July 2022",NA,"True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall. However, True Detective Season 1 is undoubtedly a 10/10."
"True Detective","Funkaairo","16 February 2023",NA,"Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha."
"True Detective","redroominparis","14 January 2019",NA,"Slow paced but well acted, True Detective season 3 returns to its roots. Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface. The Cinematography and Score are fantastic, making for and eagerly anticipated re-do that erases the inadequacy of season 2."
"True Detective","mlynch5187","15 October 2015",NA,"Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. ""Hey, that's okay"" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like ""Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you"". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple."
"True Detective","TomatoesareRotten","21 February 2024",NA,"It's done exactly what the second calamitous series did to the original premise , ruined the whole stock it had re garnered in series 3 ! One step forward two steps back ? The first two episodes set out on a fixed trajectory ( with some arbitrary and random family nonsense for good measure and NO it didn't help with character development ) but then went off ( no pun intended ) on several different paths, one of which was the utterly pointless inclusion of Christopher Eccleston and THAT side story. These deviations only contributed confusion and frustration for the viewer as the main story was, by now, being diluted to the point of insignificance ?! The last episode was some of the poorest storytelling and dialogue I've ever witnessed and it had Jodie Foster contributing her fair share of the nonsense unfolding. Breathtakingly bad, it even made Alaska look terrible and that's quite a feat."
"True Detective","paiello-44319","21 February 2024",NA,"A lot of thoughts, and most of them not good regarding this series of six episodes. The acting was fine, Jody Foster is always fantastic and so was the actress that played Navarro. It was very clichÃ© and that includes the characters and the plot. Seems like they were using the momentum from the previous seasons, which were highly acclaimed. One of those series you kept saying, who is this person again? Or what was the plot again? Most of the violence and murders coming from the good guys, senseless, revenge killings. There were some nonsensical moments as well. People falling through ice after we see Alaska in total darkness with frigid freezing, cold temperatures - the ice would definitely be several feet thick. Anyway there were some threads of high quality acting, but I gave this a score of six and that was generous.My suggestion? Skip season four of the series. I think season one is still regarded as the best. If you want to watch a series that's in the same genre. Watch Fargo season five. Really good stuff."
"True Detective","sammybeno","23 January 2021",NA,"Season 1 of True Detective may be the best television I've ever seen. Its written brilliantly and has some of the best performances I've ever witnessed with Woody and Matthew. They were robbed by not winning an Emmy or Golden Globe."
"True Detective","bsamad-50088","22 November 2019",NA,"I only rated 9 because i didn't like season 2 that much , but season 1 and 3 are just a masterpieces !! Specially the acting of Matthew and Ali , the story and the script , the atmosphere they created in this show is attractive ,i fell in love with the show , one of the best i ever seen"
"True Detective","ladnerlowery","30 March 2021",NA,"I watched season 1 again last week and I am still in awe of every element of this masterpiece. The pace, the acting, everything is so perfect it is mindblowing. I remember the excitement of waiting for season 2, which evaporated after episode 1. Vince Vaughan seems to always carry the can for this seasons issues but they were far larger than one man. I was astounded how bad the second was to the first. The third season, I watched it, I can't remember it. Other than to say it was better than the stinker in the middle."
"True Detective","prabhat_kataria","13 January 2014",NA,"When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichÃ©d murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10"
"True Detective","MK_Ultra_","30 January 2024",NA,"Being a fan of the first season, skipping the second after 2 episodes in (lousy season), and lukewarm on season 3 (was okay), I'm at the point where ""can millions of people be wrong?""Probably not, but just throwing that out there.Season 4, so far, through 3 episodes---for me---is a criminally overrated slog. Who is the protagonist? Why should we care about all the unknown ""soap opera-esque"" hangups between the characters as they develop? There is the element of being derivative hanging over this (hello, John Carpenter), but the element of tribal spiritualism and some inklings of supernatural elements weigh it down as much as they are possibly keeping this series afloat. Talking put of both sides of my mouth, but the trappings of a less than suitable tying up of loose ends is running out of time and space.It's goofy at times (the few scenes with CGI are laughably bad in 2023-2024), it's boring most of the time...but the ending of the episodes bring in the element of the next episode will reveal more, but after three episodes of that same approach, I feel a further letdown on the horizon.It's kind of a mess, bottom line, and the scatterbrained script is really getting hard to watch as it unfolds in slow motion.With that said, this is the halfway point I do believe. Episode 3 out of 6 and just waiting for something to happen.Tempering expectations because a lot of the legitimate nationally publicated reviewers that I normally trust seem to go cuckoo for cocoapuffs over their reviewable full season preview that got me back onboard, but subjective as it can be---and even some calling this more of a ""horror"" themed season, it's falling completely flat other than a few disturbing scenes and the element of what is yet to be revealed.Edited for end of season assessment after watching finale:Absolutely a mess. They ran out of budget or couldn't find an editor to come in and clear.said mess. This is and was a complete disaster of a season, and starting to wonder about the promotional material they ran about the time of the Superbowl, where they folled.the screen with review quote snippets, if those were for all of the MAX content or this series, because a little slight of hand marketing wise might have been in play to sell this crap to the masses.This one's a hard pass."
"True Detective","amappou-565-320033","25 April 2020",NA,"Season 1 True Detective, different actors, different story, different class....absolutely amazing.....the following seasons average in comparison."
"True Detective","danielcereto","2 March 2024",NA,"I really love true detective. Season 1 is one of the greatest shows of all time. Season 2&3 were acceptable even not for everyone. Then season 4, an authentic disaster. I don't know where to start but I'll try.First, the cast (Almost all women) does a really bad job. It is a mixture of bad acting and cheap soap opera feeling. But, to be clear, I have a huge respect to Jodie Foster (Clarice) , but here her acting skills are embarrassing. She is as cold as the supposed plastic ice (embarrassing too).Second, the story is bland, full of cliches and overall unbelievable. A wasted opportunity.So, if you love True Detective, do not watch this. If you love Jodie Foster, watch The Silence of the Lambs. And if you want a great show watch Fargo the first 3 seasons instead."
"True Detective","tomhg38","13 January 2014",NA,"This is a show which almost bathes in success before it's begun. With it's cast and their pedigree of work i cant see many people interested in this type of television not seeing it.Regardless the pilot grips you with non-linear suspense driven story telling. Vaguely some kind of serial killer murders young women in a ritualistic manner and our 2 protagonists catch the case. What follows is a tantalising taste of what I'm sure will become one of the most well wrought shows of the year, as is the norm for HBO. Teased with mystery and the promise of a story worth hearing being told in a superb manner, Its hard not to fully recommend every mature adult checking this show out.The only demographic that wont be thoroughly satisfied with this work are people looking for lighter ""easy watching"" style programs. This isn't an episodic cop show, True Detective is dark and unapologetically twisted."
"True Detective","Silicone54","13 February 2024",NA,"First 15 minutes of episode 1 was pretty good and Jodie Foster is the lead? Yeah lets go!!! Well they went every which way with the entire story and even characters are all doing their own thing. Almost feels like they used different writers to handle each characters' plotlines and no one bothered to check if any of it makes sense.I watched every week and I cannot remember any names including the leads. Impossible to follow the story as they jump from major plot lines to another without any relevance to each other or continuity. I may just stop and wait until the season is complete so I can binge it. Perhaps watching episodes back to back will make it sink in. I love the True Detective series up until this one.I give season 4 a 2-star because of Jodie Foster but honestly she's not convincing at all in her role."
"True Detective","mathomas-28053","2 February 2024",NA,"Season 4 (Night Country)
There are many positive reviews for Jody Foster's ""Night Country."" I cannot imagine we are watching the same thing. I have recently watched the first three seasons of True Detective, and found them all to be very good or excellent. The mysteries were good and complicated. The acting and direction were good. The screenplays were excellent, full of wit, innuendo, plot revealed piece by piece, some wonderful lines of dialogue. Even the minor characters were interested and well-acted.This fourth season is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Nothing about the plot is interesting. None of the characters is interesting. There has not been one witty or memorable line of dialog. I can barely drag myself to watch the next episode. Extremely disappointing.Obviously, this could be a gender difference. The first three seasons were written by guys, about guys, and I am a guy. This fourth season is written by a woman, and stars female detectives. But I have seen PLENTY of excellent detective shows written by and starring women (mostly European) and loved them. So I don't think it's that.I don't know what you people are watching who are giving this fourth season high ratings. I'd rather watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" than suffer through this Alaskan nightmare. Also, I don't approve of bringing supernatural stuff into a detective show, if that's what this is going to turn out to be. Murder is not done by ghosts and spirits, it is done by murderers. I honestly believe these high ratings have been bought and paid for."
