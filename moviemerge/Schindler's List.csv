"Schindler's List","Gordon-11","19 October 2009",NA,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short."
"Schindler's List","Sleepin_Dragon","26 January 2023",NA,"Businessman Oskar Schindler saved the lives of many Jews, by employing them in his factories, this saving them from going to The Concentration Camps.This was, and will forever be, one of the best films ever made, not just the ultimate story of The Holocaust, but truly as masterpiece, one of the best.If you can sit through it without being moved to the point of tears, you're made of stronger stuff than I am, the atrocities committed on those innocent people will never be forgotten. The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10."
"Schindler's List","ebiros2","17 October 2005",NA,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""
"Schindler's List","Fella_shibby","9 September 2013",NA,"Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.
Me n my kids cried during the pit scene."
"Schindler's List","EVON1TY","2 March 2023",NA,"As you may know there is lots of World War II movies. Some of them shows you the worst parts of war, this one is doing something better.Shows you the war is bad for everyone. Shows you een the little kindness is the greatest thing. Shows you ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely.""I saw so many World War II movies, non of them gave me these feelings. Most of them are just too sided with USA. Some of them just made with fictional characters. And I don't know how but some of them says war is a good thing if you're shooting bad people.Besides one of the greatest historical Screenplay, the Acting Performances just superb. I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler, Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.Scores is the soul of the movie. John Williams mades you feel that.Cinematography is too great, watching this movie with these colors makes the movie too much realistic. I don't know how is it doing that. I know some of the movies are trying that when flashback scenes are coming, but most of them are not being successful at.Art Direction and Set Decoration is also too varied. They managed to do an enormous job. You feel the greatness in the movie with varied places and objects."
"Schindler's List","mark.waltz","29 August 2014",NA,"History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."
"Schindler's List","SnoopyStyle","23 March 2014",NA,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end."
"Schindler's List","vtburns","11 December 2000",NA,"I have only ever seen this film once, I only ever want to see this film once and I will only ever need to see this film once. It is etched on my mind. I, like many others, left in silence.  I could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film, picking small points of detail or of style, or even scoring points off the Director. It stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema, a magnificent accomplishment."
"Schindler's List","giraffelover","29 September 1998",NA,"I've seen this film one time in 1994. This is one of the best movies ever made, but many scenes of the film are so brutal, that I'm afraid to see this film for a second time."
"Schindler's List","padawanmovies","16 August 2017",NA,"To all the ppl on the 1st four review pages, u r all idiots... To say that this movie's overrated and one sided makes u all seem naive. This is an emotional movie that emphasizes one of the worst periods in the history of mankind. I'm a big list person so anytime there's a list of the 10, 20, 50 best(fill in the blank) I must check it out. Now usually I'll take a gander at something jus so I can try to understand y it's considered great: 2 in particular I'm not a fan of include Pulp Fiction and Annie Hall. But I digress, this movie was well worth the years it took me to finally watch, had it on the DVR since March. All of the acting is absolutely stellar. I would say I hope an amazing story told on celluloid would encourage people to treat one another better, but given the state of things in parts of the world I'll say we're a long way from that. ONE OF THE MOST GUT WRENCHING MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN"
"Schindler's List","Instant_Palmer","10 April 2022",NA,"Leaves one speechless - Moving, somber, and horrifying. One of Humankind's worst moments - Something no one should ever forget. This is filmmaking at its finest. Even with 7 Oscars, deserved more. On par with the greatest films ever made. Certainly cemented Steven as one of the greatest filmmakers to walk the planet. A personal labor by Steven, it is clearly something he felt compelled to do, and it shows in the intricate detail of every scene. ""Schindler's List"" is nearly flawless in every category. A must-see film for reasons beyond entertainment.🙏"
"Schindler's List","Hitchcoc","28 March 2006",NA,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
"Schindler's List","TheLittleSongbird","4 June 2009",NA,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."
"Schindler's List","classicsoncall","18 October 2006",NA,"Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."
"Schindler's List","ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017",NA,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."
"Schindler's List","troy-manatunga","29 June 2016",NA,"SCHINDLERS LIST is Jewel.Evil and indifference we see all around us every day. And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm – Michael Wilmington 93'The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty! If you appreciate art, this is a masterpiece.TITLE: SCHINDLERS LIST DIRECTED BY: STEVEN SPIELBERG STARRING: LIAM NEESON, BEN KINGSLEY & RALPH FIENNES RATED:R RATING: 09/10 RUNTIME: 195 Minutes"
"Schindler's List","RossRivero99","16 May 2014",NA,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."
"Schindler's List","zaremskya-23761","23 October 2017",NA,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

Regardless of how much praise I include in my review, I should still think it deserves more. Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there. I was embarrassed when I actually started clapping in that classroom where I first watched this movie. I'd recommend it to anybody and it remains in my top selection of movies. Outstanding."

It shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond all words."
"Schindler's List","Docterry","31 March 1999",NA,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."

"Schindler's List","mark.waltz","29 August 2014",NA,"History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."
"Schindler's List","SnoopyStyle","23 March 2014",NA,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end."

But I digress, this movie was well worth the years it took me to finally watch, had it on the DVR since March. All of the acting is absolutely stellar. I would say I hope an amazing story told on celluloid would encourage people to treat one another better, but given the state of things in parts of the world I'll say we're a long way from that.

"Schindler's List","Hitchcoc","28 March 2006",NA,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
"Schindler's List","TheLittleSongbird","4 June 2009",NA,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."
"Schindler's List","classicsoncall","18 October 2006",NA,"Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."
"Schindler's List","ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017",NA,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."
"Schindler's List","troy-manatunga","29 June 2016",NA,"SCHINDLERS LIST is Jewel.Evil and indifference we see all around us every day. And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm – Michael Wilmington 93'The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty!

"Schindler's List","RossRivero99","16 May 2014",NA,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."
"Schindler's List","zaremskya-23761","23 October 2017",NA,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

"Schindler's List","Docterry","31 March 1999",NA,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."

The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10."

The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""

Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."
"Schindler's List","SnoopyStyle","23 March 2014",NA,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done.

"Schindler's List","Hitchcoc","28 March 2006",NA,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
"Schindler's List","TheLittleSongbird","4 June 2009",NA,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."
"Schindler's List","classicsoncall","18 October 2006",NA,"Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."
"Schindler's List","ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017",NA,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."
"Schindler's List","troy-manatunga","29 June 2016",NA,"SCHINDLERS LIST is Jewel.Evil and indifference we see all around us every day. And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm – Michael Wilmington 93'The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty!

"Schindler's List","RossRivero99","16 May 2014",NA,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."
"Schindler's List","zaremskya-23761","23 October 2017",NA,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there.

"Schindler's List","Docterry","31 March 1999",NA,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."

The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10."
"Schindler's List","ebiros2","17 October 2005",NA,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""
"Schindler's List","Fella_shibby","9 September 2013",NA,"Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.

"Schindler's List","mark.waltz","29 August 2014",NA,"History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."

"Schindler's List","Instant_Palmer","10 April 2022",NA,"Leaves one speechless - Moving, somber, and horrifying. One of Humankind's worst moments - Something no one should ever forget. This is filmmaking at its finest. Even with 7 Oscars, deserved more. On par with the greatest films ever made. Certainly cemented Steven as one of the greatest filmmakers to walk the planet. A personal labor by Steven, it is clearly something he felt compelled to do, and it shows in the intricate detail of every scene. ""Schindler's List"" is nearly flawless in every category. A must-see film for reasons beyond entertainment.🙏"
"Schindler's List","Hitchcoc","28 March 2006",NA,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
"Schindler's List","TheLittleSongbird","4 June 2009",NA,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."
"Schindler's List","classicsoncall","18 October 2006",NA,"Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."
"Schindler's List","ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017",NA,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."
"Schindler's List","troy-manatunga","29 June 2016",NA,"SCHINDLERS LIST is Jewel.Evil and indifference we see all around us every day. And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm – Michael Wilmington 93'The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty! If you appreciate art, this is a masterpiece.TITLE: SCHINDLERS LIST DIRECTED BY: STEVEN SPIELBERG STARRING: LIAM NEESON, BEN KINGSLEY & RALPH FIENNES RATED:R RATING: 09/10 RUNTIME: 195 Minutes"
"Schindler's List","RossRivero99","16 May 2014",NA,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."
"Schindler's List","zaremskya-23761","23 October 2017",NA,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."
"Schindler's List","o-31546","20 June 2017",NA,"Schindler's List is one of the most critically acclaimed films in the 1990s. This Steven Spielberg historical movie, based on the life of Oskar Schindler, an ethnic German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working. ----Yidioo, my name and site"
"Schindler's List","Goldwaterproductions","5 June 2012",NA,"Perfect. Perfect on every level from the acting to the script, to the cinematography, everything about this movie is 100% perfect. I've watched this movie 3 times and there's nothing I would change. Even the insanely long running time of 3 hours and 15 minutes isn't a bad thing. Every scene feels important. I would highly recommend watching this movie. Although it is very violent and very heartbreaking so be warned!! But if you can handle strong violence and a difficult subject matter such as the Holocaust, then you must see it. It's my favorite movie, and I hope it will one day become yours too.Rating: 10/10"
"Schindler's List","s-tb","20 November 2011",NA,"This movie, Schindler's List, is hands-down without a doubt one of the greatest films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Regardless of how much praise I include in my review, I should still think it deserves more. Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there. I was embarrassed when I actually started clapping in that classroom where I first watched this movie. I'd recommend it to anybody and it remains in my top selection of movies. Outstanding."

"Schindler's List","crawdidd424","3 May 2002",NA,"This Movie was sensational. It was a piece of art along with being informational. It told people about the holocaust, and it also told people about the human spirit. It shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond all words."
"Schindler's List","Docterry","31 March 1999",NA,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."
"Schindler's List","justinwest-14208","22 January 2022",NA,"I don't think I need to explain why this is a ten. Every moment in this film is there for a reason. It's just a masterpiece. Liam Neeson does an amazing job as usual. This movie is one of the most moving pictures ever put on a screen. It should be required to watch in school."
"Schindler's List","Gordon-11","19 October 2009",NA,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short."
"Schindler's List","Sleepin_Dragon","26 January 2023",NA,"Businessman Oskar Schindler saved the lives of many Jews, by employing them in his factories, this saving them from going to The Concentration Camps.This was, and will forever be, one of the best films ever made, not just the ultimate story of The Holocaust, but truly as masterpiece, one of the best.If you can sit through it without being moved to the point of tears, you're made of stronger stuff than I am, the atrocities committed on those innocent people will never be forgotten. The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10."
"Schindler's List","ebiros2","17 October 2005",NA,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""
"Schindler's List","Fella_shibby","9 September 2013",NA,"Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.

"Schindler's List","EVON1TY","2 March 2023",NA,"As you may know there is lots of World War II movies. Some of them shows you the worst parts of war, this one is doing something better.Shows you the war is bad for everyone. Shows you een the little kindness is the greatest thing. Shows you ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely.""I saw so many World War II movies, non of them gave me these feelings. Most of them are just too sided with USA. Some of them just made with fictional characters. And I don't know how but some of them says war is a good thing if you're shooting bad people.Besides one of the greatest historical Screenplay, the Acting Performances just superb. I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler, Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.Scores is the soul of the movie. John Williams mades you feel that.Cinematography is too great, watching this movie with these colors makes the movie too much realistic. I don't know how is it doing that. I know some of the movies are trying that when flashback scenes are coming, but most of them are not being successful at.Art Direction and Set Decoration is also too varied. They managed to do an enormous job. You feel the greatness in the movie with varied places and objects."
"Schindler's List","mark.waltz","29 August 2014",NA,"History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."
"Schindler's List","SnoopyStyle","23 March 2014",NA,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done.

"Schindler's List","ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017",NA,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."
"Schindler's List","troy-manatunga","29 June 2016",NA,"SCHINDLERS LIST is Jewel.Evil and indifference we see all around us every day. And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm – Michael Wilmington 93'The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty! If you appreciate art, this is a masterpiece.TITLE: SCHINDLERS LIST DIRECTED BY: STEVEN SPIELBERG STARRING: LIAM NEESON, BEN KINGSLEY & RALPH FIENNES RATED:R RATING: 09/10 RUNTIME: 195 Minutes"
"Schindler's List","RossRivero99","16 May 2014",NA,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."
"Schindler's List","zaremskya-23761","23 October 2017",NA,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

This Steven Spielberg historical movie, based on the life of Oskar Schindler, an ethnic German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories.

I've watched this movie 3 times and there's nothing I would change. Even the insanely long running time of 3 hours and 15 minutes isn't a bad thing. Every scene feels important. I would highly recommend watching this movie. Although it is very violent and very heartbreaking so be warned!!

Regardless of how much praise I include in my review, I should still think it deserves more. Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there. I was embarrassed when I actually started clapping in that classroom where I first watched this movie. I'd recommend it to anybody and it remains in my top selection of movies. Outstanding."

"Schindler's List","crawdidd424","3 May 2002",NA,"This Movie was sensational. It was a piece of art along with being informational. It told people about the holocaust, and it also told people about the human spirit. It shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond all words."
"Schindler's List","Docterry","31 March 1999",NA,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."
"Schindler's List","justinwest-14208","22 January 2022",NA,"I don't think I need to explain why this is a ten. Every moment in this film is there for a reason. It's just a masterpiece.

"Schindler's List","Gordon-11","19 October 2009",NA,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short."
"Schindler's List","Sleepin_Dragon","26 January 2023",NA,"Businessman Oskar Schindler saved the lives of many Jews, by employing them in his factories, this saving them from going to The Concentration Camps.This was, and will forever be, one of the best films ever made, not just the ultimate story of The Holocaust, but truly as masterpiece, one of the best.If you can sit through it without being moved to the point of tears, you're made of stronger stuff than I am, the atrocities committed on those innocent people will never be forgotten. The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10."
"Schindler's List","ebiros2","17 October 2005",NA,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""
"Schindler's List","Fella_shibby","9 September 2013",NA,"Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.

"Schindler's List","EVON1TY","2 March 2023",NA,"As you may know there is lots of World War II movies. Some of them shows you the worst parts of war, this one is doing something better.Shows you the war is bad for everyone. Shows you een the little kindness is the greatest thing. Shows you ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely.""I saw so many World War II movies, non of them gave me these feelings. Most of them are just too sided with USA. Some of them just made with fictional characters. And I don't know how but some of them says war is a good thing if you're shooting bad people.Besides one of the greatest historical Screenplay, the Acting Performances just superb. I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler, Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.Scores is the soul of the movie. John Williams mades you feel that.Cinematography is too great, watching this movie with these colors makes the movie too much realistic. I don't know how is it doing that. I know some of the movies are trying that when flashback scenes are coming, but most of them are not being successful at.Art Direction and Set Decoration is also too varied. They managed to do an enormous job. You feel the greatness in the movie with varied places and objects."
"Schindler's List","mark.waltz","29 August 2014",NA,"History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."
"Schindler's List","SnoopyStyle","23 March 2014",NA,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done.

"Schindler's List","Hitchcoc","28 March 2006",NA,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
"Schindler's List","TheLittleSongbird","4 June 2009",NA,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."

"Schindler's List","ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017",NA,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."

As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at.

"Schindler's List","RossRivero99","16 May 2014",NA,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."
"Schindler's List","zaremskya-23761","23 October 2017",NA,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

Regardless of how much praise I include in my review, I should still think it deserves more. Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there. I was embarrassed when I actually started clapping in that classroom where I first watched this movie. I'd recommend it to anybody and it remains in my top selection of movies. Outstanding."

"Schindler's List","crawdidd424","3 May 2002",NA,"This Movie was sensational. It was a piece of art along with being informational. It told people about the holocaust, and it also told people about the human spirit. It shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond all words."
"Schindler's List","Docterry","31 March 1999",NA,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."
"Schindler's List","justinwest-14208","22 January 2022",NA,"I don't think I need to explain why this is a ten. Every moment in this film is there for a reason. It's just a masterpiece.

"Schindler's List","Gordon-11","19 October 2009",NA,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short."
"Schindler's List","Sleepin_Dragon","26 January 2023",NA,"Businessman Oskar Schindler saved the lives of many Jews, by employing them in his factories, this saving them from going to The Concentration Camps.This was, and will forever be, one of the best films ever made, not just the ultimate story of The Holocaust, but truly as masterpiece, one of the best.If you can sit through it without being moved to the point of tears, you're made of stronger stuff than I am, the atrocities committed on those innocent people will never be forgotten. The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10."
"Schindler's List","ebiros2","17 October 2005",NA,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""
"Schindler's List","Fella_shibby","9 September 2013",NA,"Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.

"Schindler's List","EVON1TY","2 March 2023",NA,"As you may know there is lots of World War II movies. Some of them shows you the worst parts of war, this one is doing something better.Shows you the war is bad for everyone. Shows you een the little kindness is the greatest thing. Shows you ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely.""I saw so many World War II movies, non of them gave me these feelings. Most of them are just too sided with USA. Some of them just made with fictional characters. And I don't know how but some of them says war is a good thing if you're shooting bad people.Besides one of the greatest historical Screenplay, the Acting Performances just superb. I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler, Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.Scores is the soul of the movie. John Williams mades you feel that.Cinematography is too great, watching this movie with these colors makes the movie too much realistic. I don't know how is it doing that. I know some of the movies are trying that when flashback scenes are coming, but most of them are not being successful at.Art Direction and Set Decoration is also too varied. They managed to do an enormous job. You feel the greatness in the movie with varied places and objects."
"Schindler's List","mark.waltz","29 August 2014",NA,"History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."
"Schindler's List","SnoopyStyle","23 March 2014",NA,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done.

"Schindler's List","Hitchcoc","28 March 2006",NA,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
"Schindler's List","TheLittleSongbird","4 June 2009",NA,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."
"Schindler's List","classicsoncall","18 October 2006",NA,"Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."
"Schindler's List","ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017",NA,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."

What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."

It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there.

"Schindler's List","Docterry","31 March 1999",NA,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."
"Schindler's List","justinwest-14208","22 January 2022",NA,"I don't think I need to explain why this is a ten. Every moment in this film is there for a reason. It's just a masterpiece.

"Schindler's List","Gordon-11","19 October 2009",NA,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me.

The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10."
"Schindler's List","ebiros2","17 October 2005",NA,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""
"Schindler's List","Fella_shibby","9 September 2013",NA,"Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.

Shows you ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely.""I saw so many World War II movies, non of them gave me these feelings. Most of them are just too sided with USA. Some of them just made with fictional characters.

"Schindler's List","mark.waltz","29 August 2014",NA,"History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."
"Schindler's List","SnoopyStyle","23 March 2014",NA,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end."

"Schindler's List","Hitchcoc","28 March 2006",NA,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
"Schindler's List","TheLittleSongbird","4 June 2009",NA,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."
"Schindler's List","classicsoncall","18 October 2006",NA,"Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."
"Schindler's List","ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017",NA,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."

Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty!

"Schindler's List","Docterry","31 March 1999",NA,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."

"Schindler's List","Gordon-11","19 October 2009",NA,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me.

"Schindler's List","Sleepin_Dragon","26 January 2023",NA,"Businessman Oskar Schindler saved the lives of many Jews, by employing them in his factories, this saving them from going to The Concentration Camps.This was, and will forever be, one of the best films ever made, not just the ultimate story of The Holocaust, but truly as masterpiece, one of the best.If you can sit through it without being moved to the point of tears, you're made of stronger stuff than I am, the atrocities committed on those innocent people will never be forgotten. The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10."
"Schindler's List","ebiros2","17 October 2005",NA,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""
"Schindler's List","Fella_shibby","9 September 2013",NA,"Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.

Some of them shows you the worst parts of war, this one is doing something better.Shows you the war is bad for everyone. Shows you een the little kindness is the greatest thing. Shows you ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely.""I saw so many World War II movies, non of them gave me these feelings. Most of them are just too sided with USA. Some of them just made with fictional characters. And I don't know how but some of them says war is a good thing if you're shooting bad people.Besides one of the greatest historical Screenplay, the Acting Performances just superb. I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler, Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.Scores is the soul of the movie.

I know some of the movies are trying that when flashback scenes are coming, but most of them are not being successful at.Art Direction and Set Decoration is also too varied.

"Schindler's List","mark.waltz","29 August 2014",NA,"History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."
"Schindler's List","SnoopyStyle","23 March 2014",NA,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end."

"Schindler's List","Hitchcoc","28 March 2006",NA,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
"Schindler's List","TheLittleSongbird","4 June 2009",NA,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."
"Schindler's List","classicsoncall","18 October 2006",NA,"Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."
"Schindler's List","ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017",NA,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."
"Schindler's List","troy-manatunga","29 June 2016",NA,"SCHINDLERS LIST is Jewel.Evil and indifference we see all around us every day. And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm – Michael Wilmington 93'The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty!

"Schindler's List","RossRivero99","16 May 2014",NA,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."
"Schindler's List","zaremskya-23761","23 October 2017",NA,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."

The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10."
"Schindler's List","ebiros2","17 October 2005",NA,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""
"Schindler's List","Fella_shibby","9 September 2013",NA,"Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.

Some of them just made with fictional characters.

"Schindler's List","mark.waltz","29 August 2014",NA,"History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."
"Schindler's List","SnoopyStyle","23 March 2014",NA,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end."

"Schindler's List","Hitchcoc","28 March 2006",NA,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
"Schindler's List","TheLittleSongbird","4 June 2009",NA,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."
"Schindler's List","classicsoncall","18 October 2006",NA,"Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."
"Schindler's List","ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017",NA,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."

And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm – Michael Wilmington 93'The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty!

"Schindler's List","RossRivero99","16 May 2014",NA,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."
"Schindler's List","zaremskya-23761","23 October 2017",NA,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.

It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."

"Schindler's List","ebiros2","17 October 2005",NA,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""
"Schindler's List","Fella_shibby","9 September 2013",NA,"Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.

"Schindler's List","mark.waltz","29 August 2014",NA,"History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."
"Schindler's List","SnoopyStyle","23 March 2014",NA,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end."

"Schindler's List","Hitchcoc","28 March 2006",NA,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
"Schindler's List","TheLittleSongbird","4 June 2009",NA,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."
"Schindler's List","classicsoncall","18 October 2006",NA,"Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."
"Schindler's List","ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017",NA,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."

And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm – Michael Wilmington 93'The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty!

"Schindler's List","RossRivero99","16 May 2014",NA,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."
"Schindler's List","zaremskya-23761","23 October 2017",NA,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

"Schindler's List","Docterry","31 March 1999",NA,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."

"Schindler's List","mark.waltz","29 August 2014",NA,"History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."
"Schindler's List","SnoopyStyle","23 March 2014",NA,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end."

But I digress, this movie was well worth the years it took me to finally watch, had it on the DVR since March. All of the acting is absolutely stellar. I would say I hope an amazing story told on celluloid would encourage people to treat one another better, but given the state of things in parts of the world I'll say we're a long way from that.

This is filmmaking at its finest. Even with 7 Oscars, deserved more. On par with the greatest films ever made. Certainly cemented Steven as one of the greatest filmmakers to walk the planet. A personal labor by Steven, it is clearly something he felt compelled to do, and it shows in the intricate detail of every scene. ""Schindler's List"" is nearly flawless in every category. A must-see film for reasons beyond entertainment.🙏"
"Schindler's List","Hitchcoc","28 March 2006",NA,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
"Schindler's List","TheLittleSongbird","4 June 2009",NA,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."
"Schindler's List","classicsoncall","18 October 2006",NA,"Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."
"Schindler's List","ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017",NA,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."
"Schindler's List","troy-manatunga","29 June 2016",NA,"SCHINDLERS LIST is Jewel.Evil and indifference we see all around us every day. And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm – Michael Wilmington 93'The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty!

"Schindler's List","RossRivero99","16 May 2014",NA,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."
"Schindler's List","zaremskya-23761","23 October 2017",NA,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there.

"Schindler's List","Docterry","31 March 1999",NA,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."

The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10."
"Schindler's List","ebiros2","17 October 2005",NA,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""

Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me.

Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested.

Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."
"Schindler's List","SnoopyStyle","23 March 2014",NA,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done.

"Schindler's List","Hitchcoc","28 March 2006",NA,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
"Schindler's List","TheLittleSongbird","4 June 2009",NA,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."
"Schindler's List","classicsoncall","18 October 2006",NA,"Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."
"Schindler's List","ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017",NA,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."
"Schindler's List","troy-manatunga","29 June 2016",NA,"SCHINDLERS LIST is Jewel.Evil and indifference we see all around us every day. And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm – Michael Wilmington 93'The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty!

"Schindler's List","RossRivero99","16 May 2014",NA,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."
"Schindler's List","zaremskya-23761","23 October 2017",NA,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

Regardless of how much praise I include in my review, I should still think it deserves more. Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there.

It shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond all words."
"Schindler's List","Docterry","31 March 1999",NA,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."

"Schindler's List","Sleepin_Dragon","26 January 2023",NA,"Businessman Oskar Schindler saved the lives of many Jews, by employing them in his factories, this saving them from going to The Concentration Camps.This was, and will forever be, one of the best films ever made, not just the ultimate story of The Holocaust, but truly as masterpiece, one of the best.If you can sit through it without being moved to the point of tears, you're made of stronger stuff than I am, the atrocities committed on those innocent people will never be forgotten. The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10."
"Schindler's List","ebiros2","17 October 2005",NA,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""
"Schindler's List","Fella_shibby","9 September 2013",NA,"Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.

"Schindler's List","mark.waltz","29 August 2014",NA,"History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."

"Schindler's List","Instant_Palmer","10 April 2022",NA,"Leaves one speechless - Moving, somber, and horrifying. One of Humankind's worst moments - Something no one should ever forget. This is filmmaking at its finest. Even with 7 Oscars, deserved more. On par with the greatest films ever made. Certainly cemented Steven as one of the greatest filmmakers to walk the planet. A personal labor by Steven, it is clearly something he felt compelled to do, and it shows in the intricate detail of every scene. ""Schindler's List"" is nearly flawless in every category. A must-see film for reasons beyond entertainment.🙏"
"Schindler's List","Hitchcoc","28 March 2006",NA,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
"Schindler's List","TheLittleSongbird","4 June 2009",NA,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."
"Schindler's List","classicsoncall","18 October 2006",NA,"Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."
"Schindler's List","ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017",NA,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."
"Schindler's List","troy-manatunga","29 June 2016",NA,"SCHINDLERS LIST is Jewel.Evil and indifference we see all around us every day. And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm – Michael Wilmington 93'The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty! If you appreciate art, this is a masterpiece.TITLE: SCHINDLERS LIST DIRECTED BY: STEVEN SPIELBERG STARRING: LIAM NEESON, BEN KINGSLEY & RALPH FIENNES RATED:R RATING: 09/10 RUNTIME: 195 Minutes"
"Schindler's List","RossRivero99","16 May 2014",NA,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."
"Schindler's List","zaremskya-23761","23 October 2017",NA,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."
"Schindler's List","o-31546","20 June 2017",NA,"Schindler's List is one of the most critically acclaimed films in the 1990s. This Steven Spielberg historical movie, based on the life of Oskar Schindler, an ethnic German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working. ----Yidioo, my name and site"
"Schindler's List","Goldwaterproductions","5 June 2012",NA,"Perfect. Perfect on every level from the acting to the script, to the cinematography, everything about this movie is 100% perfect. I've watched this movie 3 times and there's nothing I would change. Even the insanely long running time of 3 hours and 15 minutes isn't a bad thing. Every scene feels important. I would highly recommend watching this movie. Although it is very violent and very heartbreaking so be warned!! But if you can handle strong violence and a difficult subject matter such as the Holocaust, then you must see it. It's my favorite movie, and I hope it will one day become yours too.Rating: 10/10"
"Schindler's List","s-tb","20 November 2011",NA,"This movie, Schindler's List, is hands-down without a doubt one of the greatest films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Regardless of how much praise I include in my review, I should still think it deserves more. Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there. I was embarrassed when I actually started clapping in that classroom where I first watched this movie. I'd recommend it to anybody and it remains in my top selection of movies. Outstanding."

"Schindler's List","crawdidd424","3 May 2002",NA,"This Movie was sensational. It was a piece of art along with being informational. It told people about the holocaust, and it also told people about the human spirit. It shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond all words."
"Schindler's List","Docterry","31 March 1999",NA,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."
"Schindler's List","justinwest-14208","22 January 2022",NA,"I don't think I need to explain why this is a ten. Every moment in this film is there for a reason. It's just a masterpiece. Liam Neeson does an amazing job as usual. This movie is one of the most moving pictures ever put on a screen. It should be required to watch in school."
